# Archive

This folder contains archived logs and outputs that are not generated by the current assistant runs. Files here are kept for reference and to keep the project root tidy.

Subfolders:
- `logs/`: Archived legacy log files (e.g., `output.log`, `output1.log`, `output2.log`, `single_test.log`).
