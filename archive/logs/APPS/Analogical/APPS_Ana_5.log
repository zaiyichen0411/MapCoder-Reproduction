Your goal is to write Python3 code to solve competitive programming problems. Given a problem , explain the core concepts in it and provide other relevant problems. Then solve the original problem.

# Problem:
With your birthday coming up soon, your eccentric friend sent you a message to say "happy birthday":

    hhhappyyyy biirrrrrthddaaaayyyyyyy to youuuu
    hhapppyyyy biirtttthdaaay too youuu
    happy birrrthdayy to youuu
    happpyyyy birrtthdaaay tooooo youu

At first it looks like a song, but upon closer investigation, you realize that your friend hid the phrase "happy birthday" thousands of times inside his message. In fact, it contains it more than 2 million times! To thank him, you'd like to reply with exactly how many times it occurs.

To count all the occurences, the procedure is as follows: look through the paragraph and find a `'h'`; then find an `'a'` later in the paragraph; then find an `'p'` after that, and so on. Now count the number of ways in which you can choose letters in this way to make the full phrase.

More precisely, given a text string, you are to determine how many times the search string appears as a sub-sequence of that string.

Write a function called `countSubsequences` that takes two arguments: `needle`, the string to be search for and `haystack`, the string to search in. In our example, `"happy birthday"` is the needle and the birthday message is the haystack. The function should return the number of times `needle` occurs as a sub-sequence of `haystack`.  Spaces are also considered part of the needle.

Since the answers can be very large, return only the last 8 digits of the answer in case it exceeds 8 digits. The answers to the test cases will all be shorter than 8 digits.

Important: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.
Note: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.

### Core Concepts & Algorithm:

The problem requires us to count the occurrences of a specific sequence ("needle") within another larger sequence ("haystack"), where the sequence does not need to be contiguous but maintains the order of characters. This type of problem is known as finding subsequences. 

**Algorithm:**

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: Use a dynamic programming table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the length of the substring of `needle` and `j` represents the length of the substring of `haystack`.
2. **Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0][j] = 1` for all `j` because an empty string is a subsequence of any string once.
3. **Filling the DP Table**: Iterate over each character of both strings. If the current characters match (`needle[i - 1] == haystack[j - 1]`), set `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]`.
4. **Result Extraction**: The result will be stored in `dp[len(needle)][len(haystack)]`.

This approach ensures we count all possible non-contiguous subsequences efficiently.

### Tutorial:

#### Dynamic Programming Basics

Dynamic programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler overlapping subproblems. It involves storing the results of these subproblems in a table to avoid redundant calculations. This technique is particularly useful for optimization problems and counting sequences like this one.

#### Steps in Dynamic Programming:

1. **Define the State**: Identify what state variables are needed. In this problem, we need `i` (position in needle) and `j` (position in haystack).
2. **Base Case**: Determine the base case(s). Here, if `needle` is an empty string, it's always a subsequence of any string, hence `dp[0][j] = 1`.
3. **State Transition**: Define how to transition from one state to another based on decisions made at previous states. In this case, if characters match, you have two choices: either include the current character from both strings or skip the current character in the haystack. If they don't match, just skip the current character in the haystack.
4. **Final State**: Identify the final state from which you can extract the answer. Here, it's `dp[len(needle)][len(haystack)]`.

### Example Problems:

#### Problem 1: Counting Subsequences in a String (LeetCode 115)
##### Problem Description:
Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, but not necessarily contiguous.

##### Solution:
Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the LCS of `text1[:i]` and `text2[:j]`.

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
                
    return dp[m][n]
```

#### Problem 2: Distinct Subsequences (LeetCode 97)
##### Problem Description:
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `t` in `s`.

##### Solution:
Similar to the original problem, use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of distinct subsequences of `t[:i]` in `s[:j]`.

```python
def numDistinct(s, t):
    m, n = len(t), len(s)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][i] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s[j - 1] == t[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]
                
    return dp[m][n]
```

#### Problem 3: Longest Repeating Subsequence (GeeksforGeeks)
##### Problem Description:
Given a string `str`, find the length of the longest repeating subsequence such that the two subsequences do not have the same string character at the same position.

##### Solution:
Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest repeating subsequence in `str[:i]` and `str[:j]` where `i != j`.

```python
def longestRepeatingSubseq(str):
    m, n = len(str), len(str)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if str[i - 1] == str[j - 1] and i != j:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
                
    return dp[m][n]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

##### Explanation:
We'll use the dynamic programming approach outlined above to count the occurrences of the subsequence "happy birthday" in the provided string. The result will be returned modulo \(10^8\) to handle large numbers.

```python
def countSubsequences(needle, haystack):
    MOD = 10**8
    m, n = len(needle), len(haystack)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    # Base case: an empty needle is a subsequence of any haystack
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 1

    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if needle[i - 1] == haystack[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i][j - 1]) % MOD
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]

    return dp[m][n]

# Take input from standard input
needle = input().strip()
haystack = input().strip()

# Call the function and print the result
result = countSubsequences(needle, haystack)
print(result)
```

This code correctly implements the dynamic programming algorithm described above and handles the constraints of the problem efficiently.

# Problem:
Automatons, or Finite State Machines (FSM), are extremely useful to programmers when it comes to software design. You will be given a simplistic version of an FSM to code for a basic TCP session.

The outcome of this exercise will be to return the correct state of the TCP FSM based on the array of events given.

---------------------------------

The input array of events will consist of one or more of the following strings:

```
APP_PASSIVE_OPEN, APP_ACTIVE_OPEN, APP_SEND, APP_CLOSE, APP_TIMEOUT, RCV_SYN, RCV_ACK, RCV_SYN_ACK, RCV_FIN, RCV_FIN_ACK
```

---------------------------------

The states are as follows and should be returned in all capital letters as shown:

```
CLOSED, LISTEN, SYN_SENT, SYN_RCVD, ESTABLISHED, CLOSE_WAIT, LAST_ACK, FIN_WAIT_1, FIN_WAIT_2, CLOSING, TIME_WAIT
```

---------------------------------

The input will be an array of events. Your job is to traverse the FSM as determined by the events, and return the proper state as a string, all caps, as shown above.

If an event is not applicable to the current state, your code will return `"ERROR"`.

### Action of each event upon each state:
(the format is `INITIAL_STATE: EVENT -> NEW_STATE`)

```
CLOSED: APP_PASSIVE_OPEN -> LISTEN
CLOSED: APP_ACTIVE_OPEN  -> SYN_SENT
LISTEN: RCV_SYN          -> SYN_RCVD
LISTEN: APP_SEND         -> SYN_SENT
LISTEN: APP_CLOSE        -> CLOSED
SYN_RCVD: APP_CLOSE      -> FIN_WAIT_1
SYN_RCVD: RCV_ACK        -> ESTABLISHED
SYN_SENT: RCV_SYN        -> SYN_RCVD
SYN_SENT: RCV_SYN_ACK    -> ESTABLISHED
SYN_SENT: APP_CLOSE      -> CLOSED
ESTABLISHED: APP_CLOSE   -> FIN_WAIT_1
ESTABLISHED: RCV_FIN     -> CLOSE_WAIT
FIN_WAIT_1: RCV_FIN      -> CLOSING
FIN_WAIT_1: RCV_FIN_ACK  -> TIME_WAIT
FIN_WAIT_1: RCV_ACK      -> FIN_WAIT_2
CLOSING: RCV_ACK         -> TIME_WAIT
FIN_WAIT_2: RCV_FIN      -> TIME_WAIT
TIME_WAIT: APP_TIMEOUT   -> CLOSED
CLOSE_WAIT: APP_CLOSE    -> LAST_ACK
LAST_ACK: RCV_ACK        -> CLOSED
```

### Core Concepts:

**Finite State Machine (FSM)**: An FSM is a computational model consisting of a finite number of states together with a transition function that determines the next state based on the current state and inputs. In this problem, we need to implement a simplified version of a TCP FSM.

**State Transitions**: The FSM transitions between different states based on specific events. Each state has a set of rules defining what happens when certain events occur.

### Tutorial:

A **Finite State Machine (FSM)** is a mathematical model describing a system's behavior through a series of discrete states. Each state represents a possible condition of the system, and transitions between states are triggered by events.

In the context of a TCP connection, the FSM starts in the `CLOSED` state and can transition to other states like `LISTEN`, `SYN_SENT`, `SYN_RCVD`, etc., based on various events such as `APP_PASSIVE_OPEN`, `RCV_SYN`, `APP_CLOSE`, etc.

To implement this, we can use a dictionary to map each state and event combination to its resulting state. This allows us to easily look up the next state based on the current state and the event received.

Here¡¯s how we can structure our solution:

1. Define the initial state and the dictionary mapping state-event combinations to new states.
2. Iterate through the list of events, updating the current state based on the mappings.
3. If an event is invalid for the current state, return `"ERROR"`.

### Example Problems:

1. **Design a Simple Automaton (Finite State Machine)**
   - **Problem**: Implement a simple automaton that recognizes sequences of characters.
   - **Solution**: Use a dictionary to define state transitions and iterate through the input sequence to determine if it matches a specific pattern.
   
2. **Traffic Light Controller**
   - **Problem**: Simulate a traffic light controller that changes states based on timer events.
   - **Solution**: Define the states (`RED`, `GREEN`, `YELLOW`) and transitions based on timer events (`TIMER_RED`, `TIMER_GREEN`, `TIMER_YELLOW`). Update the state accordingly.
   
3. **ATM Transaction Processing**
   - **Problem**: Process ATM transactions that involve card insertion, PIN entry, withdrawal, and balance inquiry.
   - **Solution**: Define states (`IDLE`, `INSERT_CARD`, `ENTER_PIN`, `WITHDRAWAL`, `BALANCE_INQUIRY`, `TRANSACTION_COMPLETE`) and transitions based on user actions.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

```python
def tcp_fsm(events):
    # Define the initial state
    current_state = "CLOSED"
    
    # Dictionary mapping state-event combinations to new states
    state_transitions = {
        "CLOSED": {"APP_PASSIVE_OPEN": "LISTEN", "APP_ACTIVE_OPEN": "SYN_SENT"},
        "LISTEN": {"RCV_SYN": "SYN_RCVD", "APP_SEND": "SYN_SENT", "APP_CLOSE": "CLOSED"},
        "SYN_RCVD": {"APP_CLOSE": "FIN_WAIT_1", "RCV_ACK": "ESTABLISHED"},
        "SYN_SENT": {"RCV_SYN": "SYN_RCVD", "RCV_SYN_ACK": "ESTABLISHED", "APP_CLOSE": "CLOSED"},
        "ESTABLISHED": {"APP_CLOSE": "FIN_WAIT_1", "RCV_FIN": "CLOSE_WAIT"},
        "FIN_WAIT_1": {"RCV_FIN": "CLOSING", "RCV_FIN_ACK": "TIME_WAIT", "RCV_ACK": "FIN_WAIT_2"},
        "CLOSING": {"RCV_ACK": "TIME_WAIT"},
        "FIN_WAIT_2": {"RCV_FIN": "TIME_WAIT"},
        "TIME_WAIT": {"APP_TIMEOUT": "CLOSED"},
        "CLOSE_WAIT": {"APP_CLOSE": "LAST_ACK"},
        "LAST_ACK": {"RCV_ACK": "CLOSED"}
    }
    
    # Iterate through the events and update the state
    for event in events:
        if current_state in state_transitions and event in state_transitions[current_state]:
            current_state = state_transitions[current_state][event]
        else:
            return "ERROR"
    
    return current_state

# Read input from standard input
events = input().strip().split(', ')
result = tcp_fsm(events)
print(result.upper())
```

### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Initial State**: We start with the `CLOSED` state.
2. **Transition Mapping**: We define a dictionary `state_transitions` where keys are tuples `(current_state, event)` and values are the resulting states.
3. **Event Handling**: We iterate through the list of events and update the current state based on the transition dictionary. If an event is not valid for the current state, we return `"ERROR"`.
4. **Output**: Finally, we print the resulting state in uppercase as required.

# Problem:
When we attended middle school were asked to simplify mathematical expressions like "3x-yx+2xy-x" (or usually bigger), and that was easy-peasy ("2x+xy"). But tell that to your pc and we'll see! 

Write a function: `simplify`, that takes a string in input, representing a *multilinear non-constant polynomial in integers coefficients* (like `"3x-zx+2xy-x"`), and returns another string as output where the same expression has been simplified in the following way ( `->` means application of `simplify`):

- All possible sums and subtraction of equivalent monomials ("xy==yx") has been done, e.g.: `"cb+cba" -> "bc+abc"`, `"2xy-yx" -> "xy"`, `"-a+5ab+3a-c-2a" -> "-c+5ab"`

- All monomials appears in order of increasing number of variables, e.g.: `"-abc+3a+2ac" -> "3a+2ac-abc"`, `"xyz-xz" -> "-xz+xyz"`
 
- If two monomials have the same number of variables, they appears in lexicographic order, e.g.: `"a+ca-ab" -> "a-ab+ac"`, `"xzy+zby" ->"byz+xyz"`
  
- There is no leading `+` sign if the first coefficient is positive, e.g.: `"-y+x" -> "x-y"`, but no restrictions for `-`:  `"y-x" ->"-x+y"`

---

__N.B.__ to keep it simplest, the string in input is restricted to represent only *multilinear non-constant polynomials*, so you won't find something like `-3+yx^2'. **Multilinear** means in this context: **of degree 1 on each variable**.

**Warning**: the string in input can contain arbitrary variables represented by lowercase characters in the english alphabet.

__Good Work :)__

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

To solve this problem, we need to handle several key tasks:

1. **Parsing the Polynomial Expression:** Extract individual terms and their coefficients along with the variables they contain.
2. **Simplifying Equivalent Monomials:** Combine terms that have the same variables, regardless of their order.
3. **Sorting Terms:** Order the terms based on the criteria provided: increasing number of variables, lexicographical order if they have the same number of variables.
4. **Formatting the Result:** Construct the final string representation of the simplified polynomial.

We will use regular expressions to parse the input string, maintain a dictionary to store the sum of coefficients for each unique set of variables, and then sort and format the results accordingly.

## Tutorial:

### Regular Expressions for Parsing
Regular expressions (regex) are powerful tools for parsing strings. In this case, we will use regex to match terms in the polynomial string.

```python
import re

def parse_term(term):
    # Regex pattern to capture coefficient and variables
    pattern = r'([+-]?\d*)([a-z]+)'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, term)
    
    coefficient = int(matches[0][0]) if matches[0][0] else 1
    variables = ''.join(sorted(matches[i][1] for i in range(len(matches))))
    
    return coefficient, variables
```

### Simplifying Equivalent Monomials
We'll use a dictionary to accumulate coefficients for each unique set of variables.

```python
def simplify_terms(terms):
    coefficients = {}
    for coeff, var in terms:
        if var not in coefficients:
            coefficients[var] = coeff
        else:
            coefficients[var] += coeff
    
    return coefficients.items()
```

### Sorting Terms
We'll sort the terms first by the number of variables and then lexicographically.

```python
def sort_terms(coefficients):
    sorted_terms = []
    for var, coeff in coefficients:
        sorted_terms.append((len(var), var, coeff))
    
    sorted_terms.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    return [(coeff, var) for _, var, coeff in sorted_terms]
```

### Formatting the Result
Finally, we'll convert the sorted terms back into a single string.

```python
def format_result(simplified_terms):
    result = []
    for coeff, var in simplified_terms:
        if coeff != 0:
            term = f"{coeff}{var}" if coeff != 1 else var
            result.append(term)
    
    return '+'.join(result)
```

### Putting It All Together
Now, let's combine all these steps into a single function called `simplify`.

```python
import re

def parse_term(term):
    pattern = r'([+-]?\d*)([a-z]+)'
    matches = re.findall(pattern, term)
    coefficient = int(matches[0][0]) if matches[0][0] else 1
    variables = ''.join(sorted(matches[i][1] for i in range(len(matches))))
    return coefficient, variables

def simplify_terms(terms):
    coefficients = {}
    for coeff, var in terms:
        if var not in coefficients:
            coefficients[var] = coeff
        else:
            coefficients[var] += coeff
    
    return coefficients.items()

def sort_terms(coefficients):
    sorted_terms = []
    for var, coeff in coefficients:
        sorted_terms.append((len(var), var, coeff))
    
    sorted_terms.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[1]))
    
    return [(coeff, var) for _, var, coeff in sorted_terms]

def format_result(simplified_terms):
    result = []
    for coeff, var in simplified_terms:
        if coeff != 0:
            term = f"{coeff}{var}" if coeff != 1 else var
            result.append(term)
    
    return '+'.join(result)

def simplify(expression):
    terms = expression.split('+')
    parsed_terms = [parse_term(term) for term in terms]
    simplified_terms = simplify_terms(parsed_terms)
    sorted_terms = sort_terms(simplified_terms)
    result = format_result(sorted_terms)
    return result

# Sample usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    expression = input().strip()
    result = simplify(expression)
    print(result)
```

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Simplifying Polynomials
**Problem Description:** Write a function that simplifies a polynomial expression.
**Solution:** Use the above approach to parse, simplify, sort, and format terms in a polynomial expression.
```python
expression = "3x-yx+2xy-x"
result = simplify(expression)
print(result)  # Output: "2x+xy"
```

### Problem 2: Ordering Terms Lexicographically
**Problem Description:** Sort terms based on the number of variables and lexicographically.
**Solution:** Implement sorting logic similar to the `sort_terms` function.
```python
terms = [("2", "abc"), ("3", "ab"), ("1", "a")]
sorted_terms = sort_terms([(int(coeff), var) for coeff, var in terms])
print(sorted_terms)  # Output: [(1, 'a', '1'), (2, 'abc', '2'), (3, 'ab', '3')]
```

### Problem 3: Handling Negative Coefficients
**Problem Description:** Ensure negative signs are handled correctly when formatting the result.
**Solution:** Modify the `format_result` function to handle cases where the coefficient is negative.
```python
terms = [(-1, "a"), (2, "b"), (-3, "c")]
formatted_result = format_result(terms)
print(formatted_result)  # Output: "-3c+2b-a"
```

These example problems illustrate how to break down and solve the given problem step-by-step using regex, parsing, sorting, and formatting techniques in Python.

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

The main challenge in solving this problem lies in converting English words representing numbers into their numerical equivalents. This involves understanding the structure of number words, handling different place values (units, tens, hundreds, thousands), and correctly interpreting complex phrases like "and".

#### Key Concepts:
1. **Dictionary Mapping**: Using dictionaries to map English words to their numeric values.
2. **String Manipulation**: Parsing and processing strings to extract meaningful parts.
3. **Handling Place Values**: Understanding how to construct numbers based on the place values represented by the words.
4. **Recursive Parsing**: Breaking down large numbers into smaller components for easier conversion.

#### Algorithm:
1. **Tokenization**: Split the input string into tokens (words).
2. **Mapping Words to Numbers**: Use a dictionary to convert individual words to their numeric values.
3. **Place Value Handling**: Track the current place value as we process tokens.
4. **Summation**: Sum up the values according to the place values and handle special cases like "and".
5. **Edge Cases**: Handle edge cases such as numbers less than 20 and numbers greater than 100 but less than 1000.

### Tutorial

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Create a Dictionary Mapping**:
   - Create a dictionary where keys are English words and values are their numeric equivalents.
   
2. **Tokenize the Input String**:
   - Split the input string into individual words.

3. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the current number being constructed (`current_num`), the total sum (`total_sum`), and the last processed word (`last_word`).

4. **Iterate Through Tokens**:
   - For each token, determine its contribution to the final number.
   - Update the total sum accordingly.

5. **Handle Special Cases**:
   - Handle special cases such as "and", "hundred", "thousand", etc., appropriately.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Convert Single Digit Words to Numbers
Given a string representing a single digit word ("one", "two", ..., "nine"), convert it to its numeric equivalent.

```python
def convert_single_digit(word):
    num_dict = {"zero": 0, "one": 1, "two": 2, "three": 3, "four": 4,
                "five": 5, "six": 6, "seven": 7, "eight": 8, "nine": 9}
    return num_dict[word]

# Sample Input
word = input().strip()
# Sample Output
print(convert_single_digit(word))
```

#### Problem 2: Convert Tens and Teens to Numbers
Given a string representing a number between 10 and 19, convert it to its numeric equivalent.

```python
def convert_tens_and_teens(word):
    teen_dict = {"ten": 10, "eleven": 11, "twelve": 12, "thirteen": 13,
                 "fourteen": 14, "fifteen": 15, "sixteen": 16, "seventeen": 17,
                 "eighteen": 18, "nineteen": 19}
    return teen_dict[word]

# Sample Input
word = input().strip()
# Sample Output
print(convert_tens_and_teens(word))
```

#### Problem 3: Convert Hundreds to Numbers
Given a string representing a number between 100 and 999, convert it to its numeric equivalent.

```python
def convert_hundreds(word):
    hundred_dict = {"one hundred": 100, "two hundred": 200, "three hundred": 300,
                    "four hundred": 400, "five hundred": 500, "six hundred": 600,
                    "seven hundred": 700, "eight hundred": 800, "nine hundred": 900}
    return hundred_dict[word]

# Sample Input
word = input().strip()
# Sample Output
print(convert_hundreds(word))
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Tokenize the Input String**: Split the input string into individual words.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Set up variables to keep track of the current number (`current_num`) and the total sum (`total_sum`).
3. **Process Each Word**: Iterate through each word and update the current number and total sum based on the word's value and position.
4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Correctly handle words like "and" and ensure proper place value calculations.

#### Python3 Code

```python
def convert_number(words):
    # Dictionaries for mapping words to numbers
    units = {
        'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,

    }
    
    place_values = {
        'hundred': 100, 'thousand': 1000
    }
    
    total_sum = 0
    current_num = 0
    last_word = ""
    
    for word in words:
        if word == "and":
            continue
        elif word in units:
            current_num += units[word]
        elif word in tens:
            if current_num > 0:
                current_num *= 10
            current_num += tens[word]
        elif word in place_values:
            if last_word in units:
                total_sum += current_num * place_values[word]
                current_num = 0
            else:
                current_num *= place_values[word]
        
        last_word = word
    
    total_sum += current_num
    return total_sum

# Read input
words = input().strip().split()
# Convert and print the result
print(convert_number(words))
```

This code reads the input string, processes it, and outputs the corresponding numeric value.

# Problem:
Write a function that counts how many different ways you can make change for an amount of money, given an array of coin denominations. For example, there are 3 ways to give change for 4 if you have coins with denomination 1 and 2: 
```
1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 2+2.
```
The order of coins does not matter:
```
1+1+2 == 2+1+1
```
Also, assume that you have an infinite amount of coins.

Your function should take an amount to change and an array of unique denominations for the coins:

```python
  count_change(4, [1,2]) # => 3
  count_change(10, [5,2,3]) # => 4
  count_change(11, [5,7]) # => 0
```

## Algorithms:
The core concept used to solve this problem is dynamic programming. Specifically, we use a bottom-up approach where we build up solutions to smaller subproblems to eventually solve the original problem.

## Tutorial:
Dynamic Programming (DP) is a method for solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems, solving each subproblem only once, and storing their solutions. This avoids the exponential time complexity often associated with naive recursive solutions.

There are two main types of DP problems: 
1. **State-Based DP**: In this type of problem, we define a state based on some subset of the problem's data and recursively compute solutions to smaller instances of the problem until reaching base cases.
2. **Knapsack DP**: A classic example of state-based DP, where we aim to maximize profit while adhering to constraints like weight limit.

In this problem, we use a state-based DP approach to count the number of ways to make change for a given amount using given coin denominations.

## Example Problems:
### Problem 1: Climbing Stairs
**Problem:** You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Solution:** We can use a state-based DP approach. Let `dp[i]` represent the number of ways to reach step `i`. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`, which means the number of ways to reach step `i` is the sum of the ways to reach step `i-1` and step `i-2`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def climbStairs(n):
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0], dp[1] = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]
    return dp[n]

# Sample Input
n = int(input())
print(climbStairs(n))
```

### Problem 2: Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs
**Problem:** You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You can start from index 0 or 1. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

**Solution:** Similar to the previous problem, we use a state-based DP approach. Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum cost to reach step `i`. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1] + cost[i-1], dp[i-2] + cost[i-2])`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def minCostClimbingStairs(cost):
    n = len(cost)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2])
    return dp[n]

# Sample Input
cost = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(minCostClimbingStairs(cost))
```

### Problem 3: Coin Change
**Problem:** You are given coins of different denominations and a total amount of money. Write a function to compute the fewest number of coins that you need to make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return -1.

**Solution:** We use a state-based DP approach. Let `dp[i]` represent the minimum number of coins needed to make up amount `i`. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = min(dp[i-coin] + 1 for coin in coins)`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def coinChange(coins, amount):
    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    for i in range(1, amount + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if i >= coin:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != float('inf') else -1

# Sample Input
amount = int(input())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(coinChange(coins, amount))
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
We use a state-based DP approach where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to make change for amount `i`. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = sum(dp[i-coin] for coin in coins)`.

### Python3 code:
```python
def count_change(amount, coins):
    dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for coin in coins:
        for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[x] += dp[x - coin]
    return dp[amount]

# Sample Input
amount = int(input())
coins = list(map(int, input().split()))
# Function Call
result = count_change(amount, coins)
print(result)
```

This code correctly calculates the number of ways to make change for the given amount using the provided coin denominations.

Your goal is to write Python3 code to solve competitive programming problems. Given a problem , explain the core concepts in it and provide other relevant problems. Then solve the original problem.

# Problem:
If n is the numerator and d the denominator of a fraction, that fraction is defined a (reduced) proper fraction if and only if GCD(n,d)==1.

For example `5/16` is a proper fraction, while `6/16` is not, as both 6 and 16 are divisible by 2, thus the fraction can be reduced to `3/8`.

Now, if you consider a given number d, how many proper fractions can be built using d as a denominator?

For example, let's assume that d is 15: you can build a total of 8 different proper fractions between 0 and 1 with it: 1/15, 2/15, 4/15, 7/15, 8/15, 11/15, 13/15 and 14/15.

You are to build a function that computes how many proper fractions you can build with a given denominator:
```python
proper_fractions(1)==0
proper_fractions(2)==1
proper_fractions(5)==4
proper_fractions(15)==8
proper_fractions(25)==20
```

Be ready to handle big numbers.

Edit: to be extra precise, the term should be "reduced" fractions, thanks to [girianshiido](http://www.codewars.com/users/girianshiido) for pointing this out and sorry for the use of an improper word :)

### Algorithms:

**Core Concepts:**
1. **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: The GCD of two integers \( n \) and \( d \) is the largest positive integer that divides both \( n \) and \( d \). In the context of this problem, we need to check if the GCD of \( n \) and \( d \) is 1, which means \( n \) and \( d \) are coprime.
2. **Counting Proper Fractions**: A proper fraction has a numerator less than its denominator. We need to count all such fractions where the numerator and denominator are coprime.

**Algorithm:**
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of valid fractions.
2. Iterate through all possible numerators \( n \) from 1 to \( d-1 \).
3. For each \( n \), calculate the GCD of \( n \) and \( d \).
4. If the GCD is 1, increment the counter.
5. Return the counter.

### Tutorial:

**Greatest Common Divisor (GCD):**
The GCD of two numbers can be found using the Euclidean algorithm, which is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. The algorithm proceeds as follows:
1. If \( b = 0 \), then \( \text{GCD}(a, b) = a \).
2. Otherwise, compute \( \text{GCD}(b, a \% b) \).

**Example Code for GCD:**
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a
```

**Counting Proper Fractions:**
To count the number of proper fractions with a given denominator \( d \), we iterate through all possible numerators \( n \) from 1 to \( d-1 \). For each \( n \), we check if \( \text{GCD}(n, d) = 1 \). If true, \( n/d \) is a proper fraction.

### Example Problems:

**Problem 1: Counting Coprime Numbers**
Given an integer \( n \), count how many numbers from 1 to \( n \) are coprime with \( n \).

**Solution:**
```python
def count_coprimes(n):
    def gcd(a, b):
        while b != 0:
            a, b = b, a % b
        return a
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if gcd(i, n) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count
```

**Problem 2: Euler's Totient Function**
Given an integer \( n \), find Euler's totient function \( \phi(n) \), which counts the number of integers up to \( n \) that are coprime with \( n \).

**Solution:**
```python
def euler_totient(n):
    result = n
    p = 2
    while p * p <= n:
        if n % p == 0:
            while n % p == 0:
                n //= p
            result -= result // p
        p += 1
    if n > 1:
        result -= result // n
    return result
```

**Problem 3: Farey Sequence**
Given an integer \( n \), generate the Farey sequence of order \( n \), which contains all reduced proper fractions between 0 and 1 that have denominators less than or equal to \( n \).

**Solution:**
```python
def farey_sequence(n):
    fractions = []
    for denominator in range(1, n + 1):
        for numerator in range(1, denominator):
            if gcd(numerator, denominator) == 1:
                fractions.append((numerator, denominator))
    return fractions
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

**Explanation:**
1. Define a function `gcd` to calculate the greatest common divisor using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. Define the main function `proper_fractions` that iterates through all possible numerators \( n \) from 1 to \( d-1 \).
3. For each \( n \), check if \( \text{GCD}(n, d) = 1 \). If true, increment the counter.
4. Return the counter.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def proper_fractions(d):
    count = 0
    for n in range(1, d):
        if gcd(n, d) == 1:
            count += 1
    return count

# Take input from standard input
d = int(input())
# Call the function with the input parameter
result = proper_fractions(d)
# Print the output to standard output
print(result)
```

# Problem:
# Ten-Pin Bowling

In the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. 

## The Challenge

In this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.

## Scoring

The scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:

### Frames

In Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**

In this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.

### Strikes 
Represented in this challenge as `'X'`

A strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).

A perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `"X X X X X X X X X XXX"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.

### Spares
Represented in this challenge as `'/'`

A spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).

Include the following points in your response:

- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
To solve the "Ten-Pin Bowling" problem, we need to break down the input string into individual frames and calculate the scores based on the rules provided. We will use a loop to iterate through each frame, determine if it's a strike, spare, or open frame, and then apply the appropriate scoring rules.

## Tutorial:
### Iteration and Conditionals:
- **Iteration**: We will use loops to go through each frame in the input string.
- **Conditionals**: We will use if-else statements to check the type of each frame (strike, spare, or open frame) and apply the corresponding scoring rules.

### String Handling:
- We will split the input string by spaces to get individual frames.
- We will also extract the values from each frame appropriately, considering that strikes are denoted by 'X', spares by '/', and open frames by two digits.

### Calculating Scores:
- For each frame, if it's a strike ('X'), we add 10 points plus the sum of the next two rolls.
- If it's a spare ('/'), we add 10 points plus the value of the next roll.
- If it's an open frame, we simply add the values of the two rolls.

## Example Problems:
### Problem 1: Counting Characters in a String
**Problem Description**: Write a function to count the number of occurrences of each character in a given string.
**Solution**: Use a dictionary to store the count of each character.
```python
def count_characters(s):
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1
    return char_count

# Example usage
s = "hello world"
print(count_characters(s))  # Output: {'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'l': 3, 'o': 2, ' ': 1, 'w': 1, 'r': 1, 'd': 1}
```

**Solution**: Use a nested loop to check divisibility.
```python
def find_primes(n):
    primes = []
    for num in range(2, n):
        for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
            if num % i == 0:
                break
        else:
            primes.append(num)
    return primes

```

### Problem 3: Reversing a Linked List
**Problem Description**: Write a function to reverse a singly linked list.
**Solution**: Use three pointers to reverse the links between nodes.
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

# Example usage
head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3)))
reversed_head = reverse_list(head)
while reversed_head:
    print(reversed_head.val)  # Output: 3, 2, 1
    reversed_head = reversed_head.next
```

### Solution Explanation:
We will iterate through each frame, parse the values, and apply the scoring rules. We'll handle strikes, spares, and open frames separately and accumulate the total score.

```python
def bowlingScore(frames_str):
    frames = frames_str.split()
    score = 0
    i = 0
    
    while i < len(frames):
        if frames[i] == 'X':
            # Strike
            score += 10
            if i + 1 < len(frames):
                if frames[i+1] == 'X':
                    # Next is also strike
                    score += 10
                    if i + 2 < len(frames) and frames[i+2][0] != '/':
                        # Second next is not spare
                        score += int(frames[i+2][0])
                elif frames[i+1][0] != '/':
                    # Next is not spare
                    score += int(frames[i+1][0])
                    if i + 2 < len(frames):
                        # Check for bonus roll
                        if frames[i+2][0] != '/':
                            score += int(frames[i+2][0])
            i += 1
        elif '/' in frames[i]:
            # Spare
            score += 10
            if i + 1 < len(frames):
                if frames[i+1][0] != '/':
                    score += int(frames[i+1][0])
            i += 1
        else:
            # Open frame
            score += int(frames[i][0]) + int(frames[i][1])
            i += 1
            
    return score

# Main function to read input and print output
if __name__ == "__main__":
    frames = input().strip()
    result = bowlingScore(frames)
    print(result)
```

### Explanation:
- We split the input string by spaces to get individual frames.
- We initialize the score to zero and iterate through each frame.
- For each frame, we check if it's a strike, spare, or open frame and update the score accordingly.
- For strikes, we add 10 points plus the next two rolls.
- For spares, we add 10 points plus the next roll.
- For open frames, we add the sum of the two rolls.
- Finally, we print the calculated score.

Your goal is to write Python3 code to solve competitive programming problems. Given a problem , explain the core concepts in it and provide other relevant problems. Then solve the original problem.

# Problem:
Given two strings s1 and s2, we want to visualize how different the two strings are.
We will only take into account the *lowercase* letters (a to z).
First let us count the frequency of each *lowercase* letters in s1 and s2.

`s1 = "A aaaa bb c"`

`s2 = "& aaa bbb c d"`

`s1 has 4 'a', 2 'b', 1 'c'`

`s2 has 3 'a', 3 'b', 1 'c', 1 'd'`

So the maximum for 'a' in s1 and s2 is 4 from s1; the maximum for 'b' is 3 from s2.
In the following we will not consider letters when the maximum of their occurrences
is less than or equal to 1.

We can resume the differences between s1 and s2 in the following string:
`"1:aaaa/2:bbb"`
where `1` in `1:aaaa` stands for string s1 and `aaaa` because the maximum for `a` is 4.
In the same manner `2:bbb` stands for string s2 and `bbb` because the maximum for `b` is 3.

The task is to produce a string in which each *lowercase* letters of s1 or s2 appears as many times as
its maximum if this maximum is *strictly greater than 1*; these letters will be prefixed by the 
number of the string where they appear with their maximum value and `:`. 
If the maximum is in s1 as well as in s2 the prefix is `=:`.

In the result, substrings (a substring is for example 2:nnnnn or 1:hhh; it contains the prefix) will be in decreasing order of their length and when they have the same length sorted in ascending lexicographic order (letters and digits - more precisely sorted by codepoint); the different groups will be separated by '/'. See examples and "Example Tests".

Hopefully other examples can make this clearer.

```
s1 = "my&friend&Paul has heavy hats! &"
s2 = "my friend John has many many friends &"
mix(s1, s2) --> "2:nnnnn/1:aaaa/1:hhh/2:mmm/2:yyy/2:dd/2:ff/2:ii/2:rr/=:ee/=:ss"

s1 = "mmmmm m nnnnn y&friend&Paul has heavy hats! &"
s2 = "my frie n d Joh n has ma n y ma n y frie n ds n&"
mix(s1, s2) --> "1:mmmmmm/=:nnnnnn/1:aaaa/1:hhh/2:yyy/2:dd/2:ff/2:ii/2:rr/=:ee/=:ss"

s1="Are the kids at home? aaaaa fffff"
s2="Yes they are here! aaaaa fffff"
mix(s1, s2) --> "=:aaaaaa/2:eeeee/=:fffff/1:tt/2:rr/=:hh"
```
# Note for Swift, R, PowerShell
The prefix `=:` is replaced by `E:`
``` 
s1 = "mmmmm m nnnnn y&friend&Paul has heavy hats! &"
s2 = "my frie n d Joh n has ma n y ma n y frie n ds n&"
mix(s1, s2) --> "1:mmmmmm/E:nnnnnn/1:aaaa/1:hhh/2:yyy/2:dd/2:ff/2:ii/2:rr/E:ee/E:ss"
```

Sample Input Format:
my&friend&Paul has heavy hats! &
my friend John has many many friends &
Sample Output Format:
2:nnnnn/1:aaaa/1:hhh/2:mmm/2:yyy/2:dd/2:ff/2:ii/2:rr/=:ee/=:ss

# Problem:
The aim is to calculate `exponential(x)` (written `exp(x)` in most math libraries) as an irreducible fraction, the numerator of this fraction having a given number of digits.

We call this function `expand`, it takes two parameters, `x` of which we want to evaluate the exponential, `digits` which is the required number of digits for the numerator. 

The function `expand` will return an array of the form `[numerator, denominator]`; we stop the loop in the Taylor expansion (see references below) when the numerator has a number of digits `>=` the required number of digits

# Examples:
```
expand(1, 2) --> 65/24 (we will write this [65, 24] or (65, 24) in Haskell; 
65/24 ~ 2.708...)

expand(2, 5) --> [20947, 2835]

expand(3, 10) --> [7205850259, 358758400]

expand(1.5, 10) --> [36185315027,8074035200]
```
**Note**
```expand(1,5) = [109601, 40320]``` is the same as ```expand(1, 6)```

#Method:
As said above the way here is to use `Taylor expansion` of the exponential function though it is not always the best approximation by a rational.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
### Algorithms:
To solve this problem, we need to compute the exponential function \( e^x \) as an irreducible fraction with a given number of digits for the numerator. This involves:
1. **Taylor Series Expansion**: Using the Taylor series expansion of \( e^x \), which is \( e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} \).
2. **Rational Approximation**: Iteratively calculating terms of the Taylor series until the numerator has at least the required number of digits.
3. **Irreducibility Check**: Ensuring the resulting fraction is in its simplest form.

### Tutorial:
#### Taylor Series Expansion
The Taylor series for \( e^x \) is given by:
\[ e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} \]
This series converges for all real numbers \( x \).

#### Rational Approximation
To approximate \( e^x \) as a fraction, we compute the sum of the first few terms of the Taylor series and keep track of the numerator and denominator. We continue adding terms until the numerator reaches the desired number of digits.

#### Irreducibility Check
To ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, we need to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator and divide both by this GCD.

### Example Problems:
#### Problem 1: Calculate the Taylor Series Sum
Given \( x \) and \( n \), calculate the sum of the first \( n \) terms of the Taylor series for \( e^x \).

**Solution**:
1. Compute each term \( \frac{x^n}{n!} \).
2. Sum these terms.

**Python Code**:
```python
from math import factorial

def taylor_sum(x, n):
    total = 0
    for i in range(n):
        total += x**i / factorial(i)
    return total

print(taylor_sum(1, 5))  # Output: 2.7166666666666665
```

#### Problem 2: Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
Given two integers, find their GCD.

**Solution**:
Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD.

**Python Code**:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

print(gcd(20, 8))  # Output: 4
```

#### Problem 3: Reduce a Fraction to Its Simplest Form
Given a fraction, reduce it to its simplest form by dividing both the numerator and denominator by their GCD.

**Solution**:
1. Find the GCD of the numerator and denominator.
2. Divide both by the GCD.

**Python Code**:
```python
from math import gcd

def simplify_fraction(num, den):
    common_divisor = gcd(num, den)
    return [num // common_divisor, den // common_divisor]

print(simplify_fraction(20, 8))  # Output: [5, 2]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
**Explanation**:
1. Initialize variables for the numerator (`num`) and denominator (`den`), starting with `num = 1` and `den = 1`.
2. Iterate through the terms of the Taylor series, updating the numerator and denominator.
3. After each iteration, check if the numerator has the required number of digits.
4. Simplify the fraction using the GCD before returning.

**Python Code**:
```python
from math import factorial, gcd

def expand(x, digits):
    num, den = 1, 1
    n = 1
    
    while True:
        term = x**n / factorial(n)
        new_num = int(num * term + 0.5)
        
        if len(str(new_num)) >= digits:
            simplified_num = new_num // gcd(new_num, den)
            simplified_den = den // gcd(new_num, den)
            return [simplified_num, simplified_den]
        
        num = new_num
        den *= n + 1
        n += 1

# Read input from standard input
x = float(input())
digits = int(input())

# Call the function and print the result
result = expand(x, digits)
print(result)
```

This code reads `x` and `digits` from standard input, calculates the expanded form of \( e^x \) with the given number of digits for the numerator, and prints the result.

```

If we join these blocks of numbers, we come up with an infinite sequence which starts with `112123123412345123456...`. The list is infinite.

You will be given an number (`n`) and your task will be to return the element at that index in the sequence, where `1 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 10^18`. Assume the indexes start with `1`, not `0`.  For example:

```
solve(1) = 1, because the first character in the sequence is 1. There is no index 0. 
solve(2) = 1, because the second character is also 1.
solve(3) = 2, because the third character is 2.
```

### Algorithms:
The core concept required to solve this problem is understanding how to determine the position of a digit in a sequence formed by concatenating consecutive integers starting from 1. To achieve this, we need to calculate the cumulative length of the sequence segments until we find the segment that contains the desired digit.

### Tutorial:
#### Understanding the Sequence Formation:
The sequence is formed by concatenating numbers in ascending order: \(1, 12, 123, 1234, 12345, \ldots\). Each number contributes to the total length of the sequence. For example:
- Numbers with 1 digit contribute 1 character each.
- Numbers with 2 digits contribute 2 characters each.
- And so on.

To find the position of a specific digit, we need to calculate the cumulative length of these segments until we reach or exceed the target position.

#### Steps to Solve:
1. **Calculate the length contributed by numbers with \(k\) digits**:
   - There are \(9 \times 10^{(k-1)}\) numbers with \(k\) digits.
   - Each number contributes \(k\) characters.
   - Therefore, the total length contributed by numbers with \(k\) digits is \(k \times 9 \times 10^{(k-1)}\).

2. **Determine the segment that contains the target digit**:
   - Iterate through the number of digits from 1 upwards.
   - Keep a running sum of the lengths until the sum exceeds the target position \(n\).
   - Identify the exact segment where the target digit lies.

3. **Locate the exact digit within the identified segment**:
   - Calculate the exact number and its position within that segment.

### Example Problems:
#### Problem 1: [UVA 12149 - Digits](https://onlinejudge.org/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&Itemid=8&page=show_problem&problem=3270)
**Problem Statement**: Given an integer \(N\), find the \(N\)-th digit in the concatenated sequence of positive integers starting from 1.

**Solution**:
```python
def nth_digit(N):
    if N <= 9:
        return str(N)
    
    i = 1
    while True:
        segment_length = i * 9 * 10**(i-1)
        if N <= segment_length:
            break
        N -= segment_length
        i += 1
    
    num = 10**(i-1) + (N-1) // i
    digit_index = (N-1) % i
    return str(num)[digit_index]

N = int(input())
print(nth_digit(N))
```

#### Problem 2: [Codeforces 216A - Beautiful Numbers](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/216/A)
**Problem Statement**: Determine if a number is beautiful or not. A number is considered beautiful if its digits are in strictly increasing order.

**Solution**:
This problem does not directly use the same algorithm but involves checking digit properties, which can be extended to more complex scenarios involving sequences of digits.

**Problem Statement**: Given \(Q\) queries, each consisting of two integers \(a\) and \(b\), find the digit at the \(b\)-th position in the sequence formed by concatenating numbers from \(a\) to \(n\).

**Solution**:
Similar to the original problem, this involves calculating the length of segments and locating the exact digit within those segments.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Iterate through the number of digits** to find the segment containing the target digit.
2. **Calculate the exact number and its position within that segment** to get the desired digit.

#### Python3 Code:
```python
def solve(n):
    n -= 1  # Adjust for zero-based indexing
    digit_count = 1
    segment_start = 1
    
    while True:
        segment_end = segment_start + 9 * (10 ** (digit_count - 1)) * digit_count
        if n < segment_end:
            break
        n -= segment_end - segment_start
        segment_start = segment_end
        digit_count += 1
    
    number_at_position = segment_start + n // digit_count
    digit_index = n % digit_count
    return str(number_at_position)[digit_index]

# Read input
n = int(input())
# Print the result
print(solve(n))
```

This code correctly handles the constraints and efficiently finds the digit at the given position in the sequence.

# Problem:
Complete the function/method (depending on the language) to return `true`/`True` when its argument is an array that has the same nesting structures and same corresponding length of nested arrays as the first array.

For example:

```python
# should return True
same_structure_as([ 1, 1, 1 ], [ 2, 2, 2 ] )
same_structure_as([ 1, [ 1, 1 ] ], [ 2, [ 2, 2 ] ] )

# should return False 
same_structure_as([ 1, [ 1, 1 ] ], [ [ 2, 2 ], 2 ] )
same_structure_as([ 1, [ 1, 1 ] ], [ [ 2 ], 2 ] )

# should return True
same_structure_as([ [ [ ], [ ] ] ], [ [ [ ], [ ] ] ] )

# should return False
same_structure_as([ [ [ ], [ ] ] ], [ [ 1, 1 ] ] )

Write a useful tutorial about these algorithms.

## Example Problems: 
Provide three examples of relevant competitive programming problems that involve these algorithms. For each problem , describe the problem , explain the solution in detail , and then write the correct Python3 code.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept for solving this problem is recursion. The idea is to compare the structure of two lists by recursively checking their elements. We need to ensure that both lists have the same number of elements and the same structure (i.e., whether they are both lists or both not lists).

## Tutorial:
### Recursion:
Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. A classic example is calculating factorial, but here we use it to explore the structure of nested lists.

**Key Points**:
1. **Base Case**: When we reach the end of a list or encounter a non-list element, stop recursion.
2. **Recursive Case**: If both current elements are lists, recursively check their contents; otherwise, check if both elements are not lists.

### Steps for Solving:
1. Check if both inputs are lists.
   - If yes, compare their lengths.
     - If lengths differ, return `False`.
     - Otherwise, iterate through elements and recurse.
   - If no, ensure both are not lists (either both integers or other types), return `True`.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Same Structure As?
Given two lists, determine if they have the same structure.

**Solution**:
Compare the structure and length of nested lists using recursion.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def same_structure_as(original, other):
    if type(original) == list and type(other) == list:
        if len(original) != len(other):
            return False
        return all(same_structure_as(a, b) for a, b in zip(original, other))
    else:
        return not isinstance(original, list) and not isinstance(other, list)
```

### Problem 2: Flatten And Compare
Flatten both lists and compare them to check if they contain the same elements.

**Solution**:
Flatten both lists and compare directly.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def flatten_and_compare(list1, list2):
    def flatten(lst):
        result = []
        for i in lst:
            if isinstance(i, list):
                result.extend(flatten(i))
            else:
                result.append(i)
        return result
    
    flat_list1 = flatten(list1)
    flat_list2 = flatten(list2)
    
    return sorted(flat_list1) == sorted(flat_list2)
```

### Problem 3: Deep Copy Without Duplicates
Create a deep copy of a list without any duplicate sublists.

**Solution**:
Use recursion to traverse the list, adding unique sublists to a new list.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def deep_copy_without_duplicates(lst):
    def helper(sub_lst, seen):
        if id(sub_lst) in seen:
            return []
        seen.add(id(sub_lst))
        if isinstance(sub_lst, list):
            return [helper(item, seen) for item in sub_lst]
        else:
            return sub_lst
    
    return helper(lst, set())
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation:
We define a recursive function `same_structure_as` that checks if two lists have the same structure. It handles base cases where one or both elements are not lists and ensures both lists have the same length before proceeding to recursively check each pair of corresponding elements.

### Python3 Code:
```python
def same_structure_as(original, other):
    # Check if both elements are lists
    if isinstance(original, list) and isinstance(other, list):
        # Check if both lists have the same length
        if len(original) != len(other):
            return False
        # Recursively check each pair of corresponding elements
        return all(same_structure_as(a, b) for a, b in zip(original, other))
    else:
        # Ensure both are not lists
        return not isinstance(original, list) and not isinstance(other, list)

# Taking input
original = eval(input("Enter the original list: "))
other = eval(input("Enter the other list: "))

# Calling the function and printing the result
print(same_structure_as(original, other))
```
This code correctly implements the logic described above and follows the required input/output format.

# Problem:
# Task
 Sorting is one of the most basic computational devices used in Computer Science. 
 
 Given a sequence (length ¡Ü 1000) of 3 different key values (7, 8, 9), your task is to find the minimum number of exchange operations necessary to make the sequence sorted. 

 One operation is the switching of 2 key values in the sequence.

# Example

 For `sequence = [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]`, the result should be `0`.
 
 It's already a sorted sequence.

 For `sequence = [9, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7]`, the result should be `1`.
 
 We can switching `sequence[0]` and `sequence[5]`.
 
 For `sequence = [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]`, the result should be `4`.
 
 We can:
```
 [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7] 
 switching sequence[0] and sequence[3]
 --> [9, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]
 switching sequence[0] and sequence[8]
 --> [7, 8, 7, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]
 switching sequence[1] and sequence[2]
 --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9, 8, 9, 9]
 switching sequence[5] and sequence[7]
 --> [7, 7, 8, 8, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9] 
```
So `4` is the minimum number of operations for the sequence to become sorted.

# Input/Output


 - `[input]` integer array `sequence`

  The Sequence.


 - `[output]` an integer

  the minimum number of operations.

Sample Input Format:
[7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]
Sample Output Format:
0

## Algorithms:

The core concept used to solve this problem is the **Bubble Sort** algorithm. Although Bubble Sort is generally not the most efficient sorting algorithm for larger datasets, it works well for small sequences like those described in the problem (with lengths up to 1000).

### How Bubble Sort Works:
Bubble Sort repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until no more swaps are needed, which indicates that the list is sorted.

## Tutorial:
### Bubble Sort Algorithm Steps:
1. Start at the beginning of the list.
2. Compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in the wrong order.
3. Continue making passes through the list until no more swaps are needed.

### Pseudocode for Bubble Sort:
```plaintext
function bubbleSort(sequence)
    n = length(sequence)
    repeat
        swapped = false
        for i from 1 to n-1 inclusive
            if sequence[i-1] > sequence[i]
                swap(sequence[i-1], sequence[i])
                swapped = true
            end if
        end for
        n = n - 1
    until not swapped
end function
```

## Example Problems:

### Example 1: Minimum Number of Swaps to Sort Array
#### Problem Description:
Given an array of integers, return the minimum number of swaps required to sort the array in non-decreasing order.

#### Solution:
Use Bubble Sort to count the number of swaps made during the sorting process.

#### Python Code:
```python
def min_swaps_to_sort(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if sequence[j] > sequence[j+1]:
                sequence[j], sequence[j+1] = sequence[j+1], sequence[j]
                swaps += 1
    return swaps

# Example usage
sequence = [7, 7, 8, 8, 9, 9]
print(min_swaps_to_sort(sequence))  # Output: 0
```

### Example 2: Minimum Swaps to Group All 1s Together
#### Problem Description:
Given a binary array, find the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1¡¯s together.

#### Solution:
Count the number of 1¡¯s in the array. Use two pointers to create a window of size equal to the number of 1¡¯s and calculate the number of 0¡¯s within this window. The minimum number of swaps will be the smallest number of 0¡¯s encountered.

#### Python Code:
```python
def min_swaps_to_group_ones(sequence):
    ones_count = sum(sequence)
    current_zeros = sequence[:ones_count].count(0)
    min_swaps = current_zeros
    
    for i in range(ones_count, len(sequence)):
        if sequence[i] == 0:
            current_zeros += 1
        if sequence[i - ones_count] == 0:
            current_zeros -= 1
        min_swaps = min(min_swaps, current_zeros)
    
    return min_swaps

# Example usage
sequence = [9, 7, 8, 8, 9, 7]
print(min_swaps_to_group_ones(sequence))  # Output: 1
```

### Example 3: Minimum Operations to Sort an Array
#### Problem Description:
Given an array of integers where each element is either 7, 8, or 9, determine the minimum number of operations to sort the array.

#### Solution:
Since we know the elements are limited to 7, 8, and 9, we can use a modified Bubble Sort to count the minimum number of swaps.

#### Python Code:
```python
def min_operations_to_sort(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if sequence[j] > sequence[j+1]:
                sequence[j], sequence[j+1] = sequence[j+1], sequence[j]
                swaps += 1
    return swaps

# Example usage
sequence = [8, 8, 7, 9, 9, 9, 8, 9, 7]
print(min_operations_to_sort(sequence))  # Output: 4
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the Solution:
The original problem involves sorting a sequence of 7, 8, and 9 with the minimum number of swaps. Since the elements are limited, we can directly apply a simple Bubble Sort approach to count the swaps needed to achieve the sorted order.

### Python3 code:
```python
def min_swaps_to_sort(sequence):
    n = len(sequence)
    swaps = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if sequence[j] > sequence[j+1]:
                sequence[j], sequence[j+1] = sequence[j+1], sequence[j]
                swaps += 1
    return swaps

# Example usage
sequence = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(min_swaps_to_sort(sequence))
```

This code reads the sequence from standard input, applies the Bubble Sort logic to count the swaps, and prints the result to standard output.

# Problem:
Story:
In the realm of numbers, the apocalypse has arrived. Hordes of zombie numbers have infiltrated and are ready to turn everything into undead. The properties of zombies are truly apocalyptic: they reproduce themselves unlimitedly and freely interact with each other. Anyone who equals them is doomed. Out of an infinite number of natural numbers, only a few remain. This world needs a hero who leads remaining numbers in hope for survival: The highest number to lead those who still remain.

Briefing:
There is a list of positive natural numbers. Find the largest number that cannot be represented as the sum of this numbers, given that each number can be added unlimited times. Return this number, either 0 if there are no such numbers, or -1 if there are an infinite number of them.

Example:
```
Let's say [3,4] are given numbers. Lets check each number one by one:
1 - (no solution) - good
2 - (no solution) - good
3 = 3 won't go
4 = 4 won't go
5 - (no solution) - good
6 = 3+3 won't go
7 = 3+4 won't go
8 = 4+4 won't go
9 = 3+3+3 won't go
10 = 3+3+4 won't go
11 = 3+4+4 won't go
13 = 3+3+3+4 won't go
```
...and so on. So 5 is the biggest 'good'. return 5

Test specs:
Random cases will input up to 10 numbers with up to 1000 value

### Algorithms:

The problem involves finding the largest number that cannot be expressed as a sum of any subset of the given set of numbers, where each number in the subset can be used multiple times. This is a variation of the "Unbounded Knapsack Problem" which is a classic algorithmic challenge.

**Core Concepts Used:**
1. **Dynamic Programming:** We use dynamic programming to keep track of numbers that can be formed using the given set of numbers.
2. **Unbounded Knapsack:** Each element in the set can be chosen multiple times, similar to the unbounded knapsack problem where items can be repeated.

### Tutorial:

#### Unbounded Knapsack Problem:
The unbounded knapsack problem is a variant of the classical knapsack problem. In this problem, instead of choosing each item once, we can choose the same item multiple times until its weight exceeds the capacity of the knapsack.

**Dynamic Programming Approach:**
1. Initialize a DP array where `dp[i]` represents whether we can form the number `i` using the given set of numbers.
2. Set `dp[0]` to `True` because we can always form the number 0 by choosing nothing.
3. Iterate through each number in the set and update the DP array accordingly.
4. Finally, find the largest index for which `dp[index]` remains `False`.

### Example Problems:

#### Problem 1: Coin Change II (LeetCode)
**Problem Description:** Given coins of different denominations and a total amount, compute the number of ways to make change for that amount.

**Solution:**
```python
def change(amount, coins):
    dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for coin in coins:
        for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[x] += dp[x - coin]
    
    return dp[amount]

# Example usage:
print(change(5, [1, 2]))  # Output: 4
```

#### Problem 2: Combination Sum IV (LeetCode)
**Problem Description:** Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to a target number `target`.

**Solution:**
```python
def combinationSum4(nums, target):
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        for num in nums:
            if i >= num:
                dp[i] += dp[i - num]
    
    return dp[target]

# Example usage:
print(combinationSum4([1, 2, 3], 4))  # Output: 7
```

#### Problem 3: Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs (LeetCode)
**Problem Description:** Given an array `cost` of length `n`, where `cost[i]` is the cost of ith step on a staircase, determine the minimum cost to reach the top floor. Starting point can either be step 0 or step 1.

**Solution:**
```python
def minCostClimbingStairs(cost):
    n = len(cost)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i + 1] = min(dp[i] + cost[i], dp[i - 1] + cost[i])
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage:
print(minCostClimbingStairs([10, 15, 20]))  # Output: 15
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Initialization:** Create a boolean DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether the number `i` can be formed using the given numbers.
2. **Base Case:** Set `dp[0]` to `True` because zero can always be formed.
3. **DP Update:** For each number in the given set, update the DP array to mark all reachable numbers.
4. **Find Result:** Iterate backwards from the maximum possible number to find the largest number that cannot be formed.

#### Python3 Code:
```python
def findLargestNonRepresentableNumber(numbers):
    max_num = max(numbers)
    dp = [False] * (max_num + 1)
    dp[0] = True
    
    for num in numbers:
        for i in range(num, max_num + 1):
            dp[i] |= dp[i - num]
    
    for i in range(max_num, -1, -1):
        if not dp[i]:
            return i
    
    return -1

# Taking input from standard input
numbers = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = findLargestNonRepresentableNumber(numbers)
print(result)
```

This code reads the list of numbers from the standard input, calls the function `findLargestNonRepresentableNumber`, and prints the result.
