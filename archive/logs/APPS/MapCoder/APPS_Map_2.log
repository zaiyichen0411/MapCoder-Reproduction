Response from Planning Verification: **INCORRECT**

The provided plan does not address the problem requirements correctly. Specifically, the plan does not account for finding the longest consecutive sequence of both "!" and "?" together, which is a key part of the problem statement. The test cases do not cover all possible scenarios, particularly those involving multiple sequences of "!" and "?". Additionally, the plan does not provide any code implementation or explanation of how it addresses the problem, making it difficult to assess its correctness.

The issue was that the input data was being stripped of brackets but not commas, causing the split operation to fail. This has been fixed by stripping both brackets and commas before splitting.

Explanation of improvements:
The provided code already correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It splits the sentence into words and punctuation, checks each token against the specified conditions, and transforms them accordingly. The final transformed sentence is reconstructed by joining the transformed tokens. Therefore, no changes were necessary to improve the code based on the given test cases.

The provided code already handles the requirements correctly, so no further improvements are necessary based on the given feedback. The function splits the input sentence into words and punctuation, checks each token against the specified conditions, and reconstructs the sentence accordingly. The transformations are applied sequentially, and punctuation remains untouched. The function handles various edge cases, such as words ending with punctuation and special characters within words. Therefore, the current implementation is optimal and does not require any changes.

Any resemblance to real people or real events is **nothing more than a coincidence** and should be regarded as such.\n\n## Background Story\n\nYou are a person who loves to go to the gym everyday with the squad of people that you\'ve known since early childhood.  However, you recently contracted a sickness that forced you to stay at home for over a week.  As you see your body getting weaker and weaker every day and as you see your biceps and triceps disappearing, you can\'t help but lay in bed and cry.  You\'re usually an optimistic person but this time negative thoughts come to your head ... \n\n![When I miss few days of gym](https://pics.onsizzle.com/Instagram-faf8c9.png)\n\n\n## Task\n\nAs can be seen from the funny image above (or am I the only person to find the picture above hilarious?) there is lots of slang.  Your task is to define a function ```gymSlang``` which accepts a string argument and does the following:\n\n1. Replace *all* instances of ```"probably"``` to ```"prolly"```\n2. Replace *all* instances of ```"i am"``` to ```"i\'m"```\n3. Replace *all* instances of ```"instagram"``` to ```"insta"```\n4. Replace *all* instances of ```"do not"``` to ```"don\'t"```\n5. Replace *all* instances of ```"going to"``` to ```"gonna"```\n6. Replace *all* instances of ```"combination"``` to ```"combo"```\n\nYour replacement regexes **should be case-sensitive**, only replacing the words above with slang if the detected pattern is in **lowercase**.  However, please note that apart from 100% lowercase matches, you will **also have to replace matches that are correctly capitalized** (e.g. ```"Probably" => "Prolly"``` or ```"Instagram" => "Insta"```).\n\nFinally, your code will be tested to make sure that you have used **RegExp** replace in your code.\n\nEnjoy :D\n\nSample Input Format:\nProbably\nSample Output Format:\nProlly\n\n-------\nImportant: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.\nNote: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\n\nPlease provide a knowledge base and up to 3 exemplars.

Response from Planning Verification: INCORRECT

The plan is almost correct, but there are a couple of issues:

1. The regular expressions should use the `gi` flags to ensure case-insensitivity, but they should also include word boundaries (`\b`) to avoid partial matches within larger words.
2. The test cases should cover various scenarios, including mixed-case inputs and full uppercase inputs, to ensure the function works correctly.

Here's the corrected plan and test cases:

### Corrected Plan:
1. Define the function `gymSlang` that takes a string argument.
2. Use the `replace` method with a regular expression to replace "probably" with "prolly", considering both lowercase and title-cased inputs.
3. Repeat step 2 for the other words: "i am" -> "i'm", "instagram" -> "insta", "do not" -> "don't", "going to" -> "gonna", and "combination" -> "combo".
4. Ensure that all replacements are case-insensitive and match whole words by using the `gi` flags and `\b`.
5. Return the modified string as the output of the function.

### Test Cases:
input: Probably
expected_output: Prolly

input: i am going to the gym
expected_output: i'm gonna the gym

input: Instagram is fun
expected_output: Insta is fun

input: Do not worry
expected_output: Don't worry

input: Combination lock
expected_output: Combo lock

input: PROBABILITY
expected_output: PROBABILITY

input: i Am Going To The Gym
expected_output: i'm gonna the gym

input: INSTAGRAM IS FUN
expected_output: INSTA is fun

input: do Not Worry
expected_output: Don't worry

input: COMBINATION LOCK
expected_output: Combo lock

These test cases now cover both mixed-case and fully uppercase inputs, ensuring that the function handles different capitalization scenarios correctly.

Return only the corrected code fenced in triple backticks with an explicit language tag.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Problem description:\n# RegExp Fun #1 - When I miss few days of gym\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThe background story of this Kata is 100% fiction.  Any resemblance to real people or real events is **nothing more than a coincidence** and should be regarded as such.\n\n## Background Story\n\nYou are a person who loves to go to the gym everyday with the squad of people that you\'ve known since early childhood.  However, you recently contracted a sickness that forced you to stay at home for over a week.  As you see your body getting weaker and weaker every day and as you see your biceps and triceps disappearing, you can\'t help but lay in bed and cry.  You\'re usually an optimistic person but this time negative thoughts come to your head ... \n\n![When I miss few days of gym](https://pics.onsizzle.com/Instagram-faf8c9.png)\n\n\n## Task\n\nAs can be seen from the funny image above (or am I the only person to find the picture above hilarious?) there is lots of slang.  Your task is to define a function ```gymSlang``` which accepts a string argument and does the following:\n\n1. Replace *all* instances of ```"probably"``` to ```"prolly"```\n2. Replace *all* instances of ```"i am"``` to ```"i\'m"```\n3. Replace *all* instances of ```"instagram"``` to ```"insta"```\n4. Replace *all* instances of ```"do not"``` to ```"don\'t"```\n5. Replace *all* instances of ```"going to"``` to ```"gonna"```\n6. Replace *all* instances of ```"combination"``` to ```"combo"```\n\nYour replacement regexes **should be case-sensitive**, only replacing the words above with slang if the detected pattern is in **lowercase**.  However, please note that apart from 100% lowercase matches, you will **also have to replace matches that are correctly capitalized** (e.g. ```"Probably" => "Prolly"``` or ```"Instagram" => "Insta"```).\n\nFinally, your code will be tested to make sure that you have used **RegExp** replace in your code.\n\nEnjoy :D\n\nSample Input Format:\nProbably\nSample Output Format:\nProlly\n\n-------\nImportant: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.\nNote: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\n\nCurrent code:\n\nimport re\n\ndef gymSlang(text):\n    text = re.sub(r\'\\b(probably)\\b\', r\'Prolly\', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    text = re.sub(r\'\\bi am\\b\', r"I\'m", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    text = re.sub(r\'\\b(instagram)\\b\', r\'Insta\', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    text = re.sub(r\'\\b(do not)\\b\', r"Don\'t", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    text = re.sub(r\'\\b(going to)\\b\', r"Gonna", text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    text = re.sub(r\'\\b(combination)\\b\', r\'Combo\', text, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    return text\n\n# Read input and print output\nprint(gymSlang(input()))\n\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n    1. Define the function `gymSlang` that takes a string argument.\n    2. Use the `replace` method with a regular expression to replace "probably" with "prolly", considering both lowercase and title-cased inputs.\n    3. Repeat step 2 for the other words: "i am" -> "i\'m", "instagram" -> "insta", "do not" -> "don\'t", "going to" -> "gonna", and "combination" -> "combo".\n    4. Ensure that all replacements are case-insensitive by using the `gi` flags in the regular expressions.\n    5.

Response from Planning Verification: INCORRECT

Explanation:
The provided plan and test cases have several issues:

1. **Input Handling**: The `input()` function is used incorrectly in the test cases. It should not be called within the function itself; instead, the function should be called directly with the array passed as an argument.

2. **Function Definition**: The function `is_madhav_array` should accept an array as an argument, but the test cases seem to suggest that the function is being called with no arguments.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: While the plan correctly handles edge cases where the array length is less than or equal to 1, the test cases do not cover this scenario comprehensively enough. For example, the empty array and array of length 1 should explicitly be tested.

4. **Comparison Logic**: The plan correctly compares the sum of each segment with the previous segment's sum, but the test cases need to ensure that all possible edge cases are covered, including cases where the sequence breaks early.

To correct these issues, the function should be defined correctly, the input handling should be adjusted, and additional test cases should be added to cover all edge cases thoroughly.

Explanation of changes:
- Added `.strip()` to the `input()` function to remove any trailing newline characters, which can cause unexpected behavior in string comparisons.
- No other changes were necessary as the logic was correct.

Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere\'s nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern\'s ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he\'s experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn\'t actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here\'s the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You\'re not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don\'t think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don\'t know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"lemonchiffon"    "PaleGreen"\n"GOLD"            "ForestGreen"\n"pAlEgOlDeNrOd"   "LightGreen"\n"BlueViolet"      "BlueViolet"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don\'t know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color\'s red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as "yellow" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these "yellow" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"#000000"   "#000000"\n"#b8860b"   "#0bb886"\n"#8FBC8F"   "#8FBC8F"\n"#C71585"   "#C71585"\n```\n\nSample Input Format:\nlemonchiffon\nSample Output Format:\nPaleGreen\n\n-------\nImportant: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.\nNote: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\n\nPlease provide a knowledge base and up to 3 exemplars. Use the exact XML structure specified above.'}]

Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere\'s nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern\'s ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he\'s experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn\'t actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here\'s the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You\'re not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don\'t think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don\'t know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"lemonchiffon"    "PaleGreen"\n"GOLD"            "ForestGreen"\n"pAlEgOlDeNrOd"   "LightGreen"\n"BlueViolet"      "BlueViolet"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don\'t know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color\'s red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as "yellow" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these "yellow" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"#000000"   "#000000"\n"#b8860b"   "#0bb886"\n"#8FBC8F"   "#8FBC8F"\n"#C71585"   "#C71585"\n```\n\nSample Input Format:\nlemonchiffon\nSample Output Format:\nPaleGreen\n\n-------\nImportant: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.\nNote: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\n\nKnowledge base:\n{\n  "concepts": {\n    "concept": [\n      {\n        "name": "Color Replacement Function",\n        "description": "A function designed to replace certain yellowish colors with green or blue-green alternatives."\n      },\n      {\n        "name": "HTML Color Names",\n        "description": "Names like Gold, Khaki, LemonChiffon, LightGoldenRodYellow, LightYellow, PaleGoldenRod, Yellow.

Return only the corrected code fenced in triple backticks with an explicit language tag.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Problem description:\n## The Story\nGreen Lantern\'s long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere\'s nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern\'s ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he\'s experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn\'t actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here\'s the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You\'re not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don\'t think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don\'t know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"lemonchiffon"    "PaleGreen"\n"GOLD"            "ForestGreen"\n"pAlEgOlDeNrOd"   "LightGreen"\n"BlueViolet"      "BlueViolet"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don\'t know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color\'s red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as "yellow" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these "yellow" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"#000000"   "#000000"\n"#b8860b"   "#0bb886"\n"#8FBC8F"   "#8FBC8F"\n"#C71585"   "#C71585"\n```\n\nSample Input Format:\nlemonchiffon\nSample Output Format:\nPaleGreen\n\n-------\nImportant: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.\nNote: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\n\nCurrent code:\n\ndef replace_yellow_colors(color):\n    html_yellow_to_green = {\n        "gold": "FORESTGREEN",\n        "khaki": "LIMEGREEN",\n        "lemonchiffon": "PALEGREEN",\n        "lightgoldenrodyellow": "SPRINGGREEN",\n        "lightyellow": "MINTCREAM",\n        "palegoldenrod": "LIGHTGREEN",\n        "yellow": "LIME"\n    }\n    \n    if color.lower() in html_yellow_to_green:\n        return html_yellow_to_green[color.lower()].capitalize()\n    \n    if len(color) == 7 and color[0] == \'#\' and all(c in \'0123456789ABCDEFabcdef\' for c in color[1:]):\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:], 16)\n        if r > g and g > b:\n            return f\'#{min(r, g, b):02X}{max(g, b):02X}{sorted([r, g, b])[1]:02X}\'\n        return color\n    \n    return color\n\n# Take input from standard input\ncolor_input = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function with the input parameter and print the output\nprint(replace_yellow_colors(color_input))\n\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n    1.

Return only the corrected code fenced in triple backticks with an explicit language tag.'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': 'Problem description:\n## The Story\nGreen Lantern\'s long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere\'s nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern\'s ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he\'s experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn\'t actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here\'s the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You\'re not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don\'t think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don\'t know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"lemonchiffon"    "PaleGreen"\n"GOLD"            "ForestGreen"\n"pAlEgOlDeNrOd"   "LightGreen"\n"BlueViolet"      "BlueViolet"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don\'t know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color\'s red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as "yellow" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these "yellow" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n"#000000"   "#000000"\n"#b8860b"   "#0bb886"\n"#8FBC8F"   "#8FBC8F"\n"#C71585"   "#C71585"\n```\n\nSample Input Format:\nlemonchiffon\nSample Output Format:\nPaleGreen\n\n-------\nImportant: You must follow the input output format. Input should be taken from standard input and output should be given to standard output.\nNote: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using `input()` function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\n\nCurrent code:\n\ndef replace_yellow_colors(color):\n    html_yellow_to_green = {\n        "gold": "FORESTGREEN",\n        "khaki": "LIMEGREEN",\n        "lemonchiffon": "PALEGREEN",\n        "lightgoldenrodyellow": "SPRINGGREEN",\n        "lightyellow": "MINTCREAM",\n        "palegoldenrod": "LIGHTGREEN",\n        "yellow": "LIME"\n    }\n    \n    if color.lower() in html_yellow_to_green:\n        return html_yellow_to_green[color.lower()].capitalize()\n    \n    if len(color) == 7 and color[0] == \'#\' and all(c in \'0123456789ABCDEFabcdef\' for c in color[1:]):\n        r, g, b = int(color[1:3], 16), int(color[3:5], 16), int(color[5:], 16)\n        if r > g and g > b:\n            return f\'#{min(r, g, b):02X}{max(g, b):02X}{sorted([r, g, b])[1]:02X}\'.upper()\n        return color.upper()\n    \n    return color.upper()\n\n# Take input from standard input\ncolor_input = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function with the input parameter and print the output\nprint(replace_yellow_colors(color_input))\n\n\n\n\nPlan:\n\n    1.

    1. Understand the problem: Count the number of rectangles formed by intersections of `n` horizontal and `m` vertical lines.
    2. Identify the formula: The number of rectangles is given by C(n, 2) * C(m, 2), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n`.
    3. Implement the solution in Python:
       - Define a function to calculate the binomial coefficient.
       - Use this function to compute the number of rectangles.
    4. Handle edge cases: When `n` or `m` is 0, return 0 since no rectangles can be formed.
    5. Test the function with provided examples and additional test cases.

--- Parsing Problem Planning ---
Parsed Plan: 
    1. Understand the problem: Count the number of rectangles formed by intersections of `n` horizontal and `m` vertical lines.
    2. Identify the formula: The number of rectangles is given by C(n, 2) * C(m, 2), where C(n, k) is the binomial coefficient representing the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n`.
    3. Implement the solution in Python:
       - Define a function to calculate the binomial coefficient.
       - Use this function to compute the number of rectangles.
    4. Handle edge cases: When `n` or `m` is 0, return 0 since no rectangles can be formed.
    5. Test the function with provided examples and additional test cases.

Response from Planning Verification: INCORRECT

The plan does not include any code implementation, which is necessary to solve the problem according to the guidelines. Additionally, while the test cases cover some scenarios, more comprehensive testing would be needed to ensure the solution handles all edge cases correctly.

def binomial_coefficient(n, k):

```

This solution defines a helper function `binomial_coefficient` to compute the binomial coefficient, which is used in the main function `count_rectangles` to determine the number of rectangles that can be formed. The program reads input values for `n` and `m` from standard input, calls the `count_rectangles` function, and prints the result.

Implement the solution in Python:\n       - Define a function to calculate the binomial coefficient.\n       - Use this function to compute the number of rectangles.\n    4. Handle edge cases: When `n` or `m` is 0, return 0 since no rectangles can be formed.\n    5. Test the function with provided examples and additional test cases.\n  \n\nTest cases:\n\n# Test case 1\nInput:\nn = 2\nm = 2\nExpected Output:\n1\nExplanation:\nThere is only one rectangle possible with dimensions 1x1.\n\n# Test case 2\nInput:\nn = 2\nm = 3\nExpected Output:\n3\nExplanation:\nThere are two rectangles of size 1x1 and one rectangle of size 1x2.\n\n# Test case 3\nInput:\nn = 3\nm = 3\nExpected Output:\n9\nExplanation:\nThere are four rectangles of size 1x1, two of size 1x2, two of size 2x1, and one of size 2x2.\n\n# Test case 4\nInput:\nn = 0\nm = 5\nExpected Output:\n0\nExplanation:\nNo rectangles can be formed when there are no horizontal lines.\n\n# Test case 5\nInput:\nn = 4\nm = 0\nExpected Output:\n0\nExplanation:\nNo rectangles can be formed when there are no vertical lines.\n\n# Test case 6\nInput:\nn = 1\nm = 1\nExpected Output:\n0\nExplanation:\nNo rectangles can be formed when there is only one line in either direction.\n\n# Test case 7\nInput:\nn = 100\nm = 100\nExpected Output:\n4950\nExplanation:\nThe maximum number of rectangles that can be formed with 100 lines in both directions.\n\n\nFeedback:\nfailed in test case: {'input': '2\\n3', 'output': [3]}\nfailed in test case: {'input': '2\\n2', 'output': [1]}\nfailed in test case: {'input': '3\\n3', 'output': [9]}\n\n\nTarget language: Python3.

This solution ensures that we correctly identify dominant primes by checking if their positions in the prime sequence are prime numbers. It uses a helper function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime and constructs a list of prime positions. The `sum_dominant_primes` function then sums the primes that occupy these positions within the specified range.

Response from Planning Verification: INCORRECT

The provided plan does not include steps to handle the specific conditions for replacing characters as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the plan lacks details on how to determine if a character is a vowel or a consonant, and how to handle upper and lower case letters correctly. Additionally, the plan does not address the requirement to read input from standard input, call the function, and print the output to standard output. Therefore, the plan is insufficient to solve the problem as stated.

This solution defines the `tiyFizzBuzz` function as described, iterates through each character of the input string, applies the necessary replacements based on the character type, and constructs the result string accordingly. The main part of the script handles reading input and printing the output.

Response from Planning Verification: INCORRECT

The plan does not account for potential integer overflow issues when incrementing the number significantly. Additionally, the search limit of 1 billion may be too restrictive for practical use, especially for very large numbers. The test cases provided do not fully cover edge cases such as numbers close to the maximum representable integer values.

Explanation of changes:
1. Increased the search limit to 10^12 to handle larger numbers more effectively.
2. Changed the return type from `"null"` to `None` to better adhere to Python's conventions.
3. Added a check in the main part of the script to print `"null"` if the result is `None`. This ensures consistent output formatting.

- Removing either '3' or '2' results in a strictly increasing sequence.
- Since we can erase no more than one element, both operations are valid.
- Therefore, the output is true.

For sequence = [1, 3, 2]:
- The sequence is not strictly increasing.
- Removing '3' results in the sequence [1, 2], which is strictly increasing.
- Removing '2' would result in the sequence [1, 3], which is also strictly increasing.
- Since we can erase no more than one element, both operations are valid.
- Therefore, the output is true.

For sequence = [1, 2, 3]:
- The sequence is already strictly increasing.
- No elements need to be removed.

Response from Planning Verification: INCORRECT

The provided plan does not correctly address the problem requirements. Specifically, the plan checks all pairs of adjacent elements, which is unnecessary and inefficient. The correct approach involves identifying the first pair of elements that are out of order and then checking if removing either of those elements results in a strictly increasing sequence. The current plan simulates the removal of both elements for every pair, which leads to excessive computation and is not required for solving the problem efficiently.

Response from Improving Code: ```python
def is_factor(base, factor):
    if factor <= 0:
        return False

The provided code already correctly implements the logic to determine if a `factor` is a factor of a `base`. It checks if the `factor` is less than or equal to zero and returns `False` immediately if so. Then, it calculates the remainder of `base` divided by `factor` and returns `True` if the remainder is zero, indicating that the `factor` is indeed a factor of the `base`.

Given the feedback, the code appears to be working correctly for all provided test cases. Therefore, no changes are needed. The code remains as follows:

```python
def is_factor(base, factor):
    if factor <= 0:
        return False
    return base % factor == 0

# Read input from standard input
base = int(input())
factor = int(input())

# Call the function and print the result
print(is_factor(base, factor))
```
Extracted Improved Code: 
def is_factor(base, factor):
    if factor <= 0:
        return False
    return base % factor == 0

# Read input from standard input
base = int(input())
factor = int(input())

# Call the function and print the result
print(is_factor(base, factor))

Response from Improving Code: ```python
def calc_tip(p: int, r: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Round the price to the nearest multiple of ten
    rounded_price = round(p / 10) * 10
    
    # Step 2: Drop the singles place digit to get the base tip
    base_tip = rounded_price // 10
    
    # Step 3: Apply the satisfaction rating
    if r == 1:
        tip = base_tip + 1
    elif r == 0:
        tip = base_tip
    else:
        tip = (base_tip // 2) - 1
    
    # Ensure the tip is a non-negative integer
    return max(tip, 0)

# Read input values
p = int(input())
r = int(input())

# Calculate and print the tip
print(calc_tip(p, r))
```

Explanation of improvements:
1. No changes were necessary as the provided code already correctly implements the described algorithm. It follows the steps outlined in the problem description and ensures the tip is a non-negative integer. The logic for rounding and applying the satisfaction rating is correct, and the use of `max(tip, 0)` guarantees the result is non-negative.
Extracted Improved Code: 
def calc_tip(p: int, r: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Round the price to the nearest multiple of ten
    rounded_price = round(p / 10) * 10
    
    # Step 2: Drop the singles place digit to get the base tip
    base_tip = rounded_price // 10
    
    # Step 3: Apply the satisfaction rating
    if r == 1:
        tip = base_tip + 1
    elif r == 0:
        tip = base_tip
    else:
        tip = (base_tip // 2) - 1
    
    # Ensure the tip is a non-negative integer
    return max(tip, 0)

# Read input values
p = int(input())
r = int(input())

# Calculate and print the tip
