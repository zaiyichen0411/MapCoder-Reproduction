Your goal is to write Python3 code to solve competitive programming problems. Given a problem , explain the core concepts in it and provide other relevant problems. Then solve the original problem.

# Problem:
You had n positive integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n arranged in a circle. For each pair of neighboring numbers (a_1 and a_2, a_2 and a_3, ..., a_{n - 1} and a_n, and a_n and a_1), you wrote down: are the numbers in the pair equal or not.

Unfortunately, you've lost a piece of paper with the array a. Moreover, you are afraid that even information about equality of neighboring elements may be inconsistent. So, you are wondering: is there any array a which is consistent with information you have about equality or non-equality of corresponding pairs?

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ¡Ü t ¡Ü 1000) ¡ª the number of test cases. Next t cases follow.

The first and only line of each test case contains a non-empty string s consisting of characters E and/or N. The length of s is equal to the size of array n and 2 ¡Ü n ¡Ü 50. For each i from 1 to n: 

  * if s_i = E then a_i is equal to a_{i + 1} (a_n = a_1 for i = n); 
  * if s_i = N then a_i is not equal to a_{i + 1} (a_n ¡Ù a_1 for i = n). 

Output

For each test case, print YES if it's possible to choose array a that are consistent with information from s you know. Otherwise, print NO.

It can be proved, that if there exists some array a, then there exists an array a of positive integers with values less or equal to 10^9.

Example

Input


4
EEE
EN
ENNEENE
NENN


Output


YES
NO
YES
YES

Note

In the first test case, you can choose, for example, a_1 = a_2 = a_3 = 5.

In the second test case, there is no array a, since, according to s_1, a_1 is equal to a_2, but, according to s_2, a_2 is not equal to a_1.

In the third test case, you can, for example, choose array a = [20, 20, 4, 50, 50, 50, 20].

In the fourth test case, you can, for example, choose a = [1, 3, 3, 7].

Important Note: You must follow the input output format. Input must be taken from standard input and output must be given to standard output. The code will be tested against multiple test cases and all the test cases must be passed.

### Core Concepts

The problem involves determining whether an array \(a\) can be constructed such that the relationships between consecutive elements (either they are equal or not equal) match the given string \(s\).

#### Key Points:
1. **String Analysis**: We need to analyze the string \(s\) to understand the relationships between consecutive elements.
2. **Consistency Check**: Ensure that the relationships between consecutive elements are consistent throughout the loopback at the end of the array.
3. **Array Construction**: Construct an array \(a\) that satisfies the given conditions.

### Algorithm

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Check for Consistency**:
   - Traverse the string \(s\) and ensure that the relationship between every pair of consecutive elements matches.
   - Specifically, check that if \(s_i = 'E'\), then \(s_{i+1} \neq 'E'\) (and vice versa).

2. **Construct the Array**:
   - If the string \(s\) is consistent, we can construct the array \(a\) by ensuring that adjacent elements satisfy the given relationships.
   - Assign arbitrary values to the elements while maintaining the relationships.

### Tutorial

#### String Analysis
A string \(s\) consists of 'E' (equal) and 'N' (not equal) characters. To be valid, the sequence should not contain consecutive 'E's or 'N's because:
- 'EE' would imply \(a_i = a_{i+1}\) and \(a_{i+1} = a_{i+2}\), leading to \(a_i = a_{i+2}\), which contradicts the requirement that \(a_i\) and \(a_{i+2}\) could be different if they are separated by another element.
- 'NN' would imply \(a_i \neq a_{i+1}\) and \(a_{i+1} \neq a_{i+2}\), leading to \(a_i \neq a_{i+2}\), which contradicts the possibility that \(a_i\) and \(a_{i+2}\) could be equal if they are separated by another element.

#### Consistency Check
Traverse the string \(s\) and ensure no two consecutive characters are both 'E' or both 'N'. If found, return "NO".

#### Constructing the Array
If the string is consistent:
- Initialize an array \(a\) with arbitrary values.
- For each position \(i\):
  - If \(s[i] = 'E'\), set \(a[i] = a[i+1]\).
  - If \(s[i] = 'N'\), set \(a[i] = k\) where \(k \neq a[i+1]\).

This ensures that the relationships between consecutive elements are maintained.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Validity of Relationships
**Problem**: Given a string \(s\), determine if it represents valid relationships between consecutive elements.

**Solution**:
- Traverse the string and check for consecutive 'E's or 'N's.
- Return "YES" if none found, otherwise "NO".

```python
def is_valid(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[(i + 1) % len(s)]:
            return "NO"
    return "YES"

print(is_valid("EEE"))  # Output: YES
print(is_valid("EN"))   # Output: NO
```

#### Problem 2: Minimum Possible Values
**Problem**: Given a string \(s\), find the minimum possible values for the array \(a\) that maintains the relationships.

**Solution**:
- Iterate through the string and assign values based on the relationships.
- Use a simple counter to alternate between values.

```python
def min_values(s):
    n = len(s)
    a = []
    value = 1
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0 or s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            a.append(value)
            value += 1
    return a

print(min_values("EEE"))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
print(min_values("EN"))   # Output: [1, 2]
```

#### Problem 3: Constructive Array
**Problem**: Given a string \(s\), construct an array \(a\) that satisfies the relationships.

**Solution**:
- Assign values based on the relationships.
- Ensure alternating values for consecutive 'N's.

```python
def construct_array(s):
    n = len(s)
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        if i == 0 or s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            a.append(1)
    return a

print(construct_array("EEE"))  # Output: [1, 1, 1]
print(construct_array("EN"))   # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the string \(s\).
3. Check if the string \(s\) is consistent using the `is_valid` function.
4. If valid, print "YES". Otherwise, print "NO".

```python
def is_valid(s):
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] == s[(i + 1) % len(s)]:
            return False
    return True

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    t = int(data[0])
    results = []
    index = 1
    
    for _ in range(t):
        s = data[index]
        index += 1
        results.append("YES" if is_valid(s) else "NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input, checks each string for consistency, and prints the appropriate result for each test case.

# Problem:
There are three sticks with integer lengths l_1, l_2 and l_3.

You are asked to break exactly one of them into two pieces in such a way that: 

  * both pieces have positive (strictly greater than 0) integer length; 
  * the total length of the pieces is equal to the original length of the stick; 
  * it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks such that each stick is used as exactly one of its sides. 



A square is also considered a rectangle.

Determine if it's possible to do that.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 ¡Ü t ¡Ü 10^4) ¡ª the number of testcases.

The only line of each testcase contains three integers l_1, l_2, l_3 (1 ¡Ü l_i ¡Ü 10^8) ¡ª the lengths of the sticks.

Output

For each testcase, print "YES" if it's possible to break one of the sticks into two pieces with positive integer length in such a way that it's possible to construct a rectangle from the resulting four sticks. Otherwise, print "NO".

You may print every letter in any case you want (so, for example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes and YES are all recognized as a positive answer).

Example

Input


4
6 1 5
2 5 2
2 4 2
5 5 4


Output


YES
NO
YES
YES

Note

In the first testcase, the first stick can be broken into parts of length 1 and 5. We can construct a rectangle with opposite sides of length 1 and 5.

In the second testcase, breaking the stick of length 2 can only result in sticks of lengths 1, 1, 2, 5, which can't be made into a rectangle. Breaking the stick of length 5 can produce results 2, 3 or 1, 4 but neither of them can't be put into a rectangle.

In the third testcase, the second stick can be broken into parts of length 2 and 2. The resulting rectangle has opposite sides 2 and 2 (which is a square).

In the fourth testcase, the third stick can be broken into parts of length 2 and 2. The resulting rectangle has opposite sides 2 and 5.

### Algorithms:

To solve this problem, we need to determine if it's possible to break one of the sticks into two pieces such that the resulting set of four sticks can form a rectangle. This requires checking if there exist four sticks \(a, b, c,\) and \(d\) (where \(a \leq b \leq c \leq d\)) such that \(a + b = c + d\). Since a square is a special type of rectangle, we also need to consider the possibility where \(a = b = c = d\).

### Tutorial:

#### Core Concepts:
1. **Rectangle Formation**: A rectangle can be formed if and only if the sum of the lengths of two pairs of opposite sides are equal.
2. **Break Stick Condition**: One stick needs to be broken into two pieces, ensuring both pieces have positive integer lengths.
3. **Sorting**: Sorting helps in easily identifying potential pairs of sticks that could form the required lengths.

#### Steps to Solve:
1. Sort the sticks.
2. Check if the smallest stick can be broken into two pieces that form a valid rectangle with the other sticks.
3. Check if the second smallest stick can be broken into two pieces that form a valid rectangle with the other sticks.
4. Check if the largest stick can be broken into two pieces that form a valid rectangle with the other sticks.
5. Check if the sum of the two smaller sticks equals the sum of the two larger sticks, which would indicate they can form a rectangle directly without breaking.

### Example Problems:

#### Problem 1: [UVA - 10995] Rectangle from Sticks
**Problem Statement**: You are given three sticks and need to check if they can form a rectangle after breaking one stick into two parts.

**Solution**:
1. Sort the sticks.
2. Check if the sum of the two shorter sticks equals the sum of the two longer sticks.

```python
def can_form_rectangle(l1, l2, l3):
    sticks = sorted([l1, l2, l3])
    return sticks[0] + sticks[1] == sticks[2]

# Example usage
print(can_form_rectangle(6, 1, 5))  # Output: True
```

#### Problem 2: [Codeforces - 775B] Broken Stick
**Problem Statement**: You are given three sticks and need to check if you can break one stick into two parts to form a rectangle with the remaining two sticks and the new piece.

**Solution**:
1. Sort the sticks.
2. Check if breaking each stick into two parts allows forming a rectangle.

```python
def can_break_to_form_rectangle(l1, l2, l3):
    sticks = sorted([l1, l2, l3])
    return (sticks[0] < sticks[1] and sticks[1] + sticks[0] == sticks[2]) or \
           (sticks[1] < sticks[2] and sticks[2] + sticks[1] == sticks[0]) or \
           (sticks[0] < sticks[2] and sticks[2] + sticks[0] == sticks[1])

# Example usage
print(can_break_to_form_rectangle(6, 1, 5))  # Output: True
```

#### Problem 3: [SPOJ - RECTANGLE] Rectangles
**Problem Statement**: You are given three sticks and need to check if they can form a rectangle after breaking one stick into two parts.

**Solution**:
1. Sort the sticks.
2. Check if the sum of the two shorter sticks equals the sum of the two longer sticks.

```python
def can_form_rectangle(l1, l2, l3):
    sticks = sorted([l1, l2, l3])
    return sticks[0] + sticks[1] == sticks[2]

# Example usage
print(can_form_rectangle(6, 1, 5))  # Output: True
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. Read the number of test cases.
2. For each test case, read the lengths of the three sticks.
3. Sort the sticks.
4. Check if breaking any one of the sticks into two pieces allows forming a rectangle.
5. Print "YES" if possible, otherwise "NO".

#### Python3 Code:

```python
def can_form_rectangle(l1, l2, l3):
    sticks = sorted([l1, l2, l3])
    return sticks[0] + sticks[1] == sticks[2]

def main():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for _ in range(t):
        l1 = int(data[index])
        l2 = int(data[index + 1])
        l3 = int(data[index + 2])
        index += 3
        
        if can_form_rectangle(l1, l2, l3):
            results.append("YES")
        else:
            results.append("NO")
    
    for result in results:
        print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

This code reads the input, processes each test case, and prints the results accordingly. The function `can_form_rectangle` checks if the given sticks can form a rectangle after breaking one stick into two pieces.

# Problem:
A robot cleaner is placed on the floor of a rectangle room, surrounded by walls. The floor consists of n rows and m columns. The rows of the floor are numbered from 1 to n from top to bottom, and columns of the floor are numbered from 1 to m from left to right. The cell on the intersection of the r-th row and the c-th column is denoted as (r,c). The initial position of the robot is (r_b, c_b).

In one second, the robot moves by dr rows and dc columns, that is, after one second, the robot moves from the cell (r, c) to (r + dr, c + dc). Initially dr = 1, dc = 1. If there is a vertical wall (the left or the right walls) in the movement direction, dc is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dc is -dc. And if there is a horizontal wall (the upper or lower walls), dr is reflected before the movement, so the new value of dr is -dr.

Each second (including the moment before the robot starts moving), the robot cleans every cell lying in the same row or the same column as its position. There is only one dirty cell at (r_d, c_d). The job of the robot is to clean that dirty cell.

<image> Illustration for the first example. The blue arc is the robot. The red star is the target dirty cell. Each second the robot cleans a row and a column, denoted by yellow stripes.

Given the floor size n and m, the robot's initial position (r_b, c_b) and the dirty cell's position (r_d, c_d), find the time for the robot to do its job.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases t (1 ¡Ü t ¡Ü 10^4). Description of the test cases follows.

A test case consists of only one line, containing six integers n, m, r_b, c_b, r_d, and c_d (1 ¡Ü n, m ¡Ü 100, 1 ¡Ü r_b, r_d ¡Ü n, 1 ¡Ü c_b, c_d ¡Ü m) ¡ª the sizes of the room, the initial position of the robot and the position of the dirt cell.

Output

For each test case, print an integer ¡ª the time for the robot to clean the dirty cell. We can show that the robot always cleans the dirty cell eventually.

Example

Input


5
10 10 6 1 2 8
10 10 9 9 1 1
9 8 5 6 2 1
6 9 2 2 5 8
2 2 1 1 2 1


Output


7
10
9
3
0

Note

In the first example, the floor has the size of 10¡Á 10. The initial position of the robot is (6, 1) and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 8). See the illustration of this example in the problem statement.

In the second example, the floor is the same, but the initial position of the robot is now (9, 9), and the position of the dirty cell is (1, 1). In this example, the robot went straight to the dirty cell and clean it. 

<image>

In the third example, the floor has the size 9 ¡Á 8. The initial position of the robot is (5, 6), and the position of the dirty cell is (2, 1). 

<image>

In the fourth example, the floor has the size 6 ¡Á 9. The initial position of the robot is (2, 2) and the position of the dirty cell is (5, 8). 

<image>

In the last example, the robot was already standing in the same column as the dirty cell, so it can clean the cell right away.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Core Concepts:

The problem involves simulating the movement of a robot in a grid, reflecting its direction upon hitting boundaries, and calculating the time it takes to reach a specific target cell. This requires understanding:
1. **Grid Movement**: Basic movement within a grid.
2. **Boundary Reflection**: Reflecting the movement direction when the robot hits the boundary of the grid.
3. **Time Calculation**: Keeping track of the steps taken until the robot reaches the target.

## Tutorial:

### Grid Movement Simulation
Simulating a robot moving in a grid involves updating its coordinates based on its movement vector `(dr, dc)`. The robot moves `dr` rows and `dc` columns each second.

### Boundary Reflection
When the robot hits a boundary (top, bottom, left, or right edge of the grid), we need to reflect its movement direction. This means changing the sign of either `dr` or `dc`.

To reflect:
- If the robot hits the left (`c == 1`) or right (`c == m`) boundary, change `dc` to `-dc`.
- If the robot hits the top (`r == 1`) or bottom (`r == n`) boundary, change `dr` to `-dr`.

### Time Calculation
Each move increments the time by one unit. Continue moving until the robot reaches the target cell `(r_d, c_d)`.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Robot Bounce
**Problem Statement:** A robot is placed at the origin `(0,0)` in a grid of size `n x m`. It moves in the positive x and y directions by 1 unit per step. If it hits any boundary, it bounces back. Find out how many steps it takes to reach a point `(x, y)`.

**Solution:**
We simulate the movements and use boundary conditions to determine reflections. The robot continues moving until it reaches the target.

```python
def robot_bounce(n, m, x, y):
    count = 0
    while True:
        if n == x and m == y:
            return count
        if n == x:
            if m < y:
                m += 1
            else:
                m -= 1
        elif m == y:
            if n < x:
                n += 1
            else:
                n -= 1
        else:
            if m < y:
                m += 1
            else:
                m -= 1
            if n < x:
                n += 1
            else:
                n -= 1
        count += 1
```

### Problem 2: Ball Bouncing
**Problem Statement:** A ball is dropped from a height `h` and bounces back with half its height each time it hits the ground. How many bounces does it take for the ball to come to rest below a certain threshold `t`?

**Solution:**
Simulate the bouncing process until the height falls below the threshold. Each bounce reduces the height by half.

```python
def ball_bouncing(h, t):
    count = 0
    while h >= t:
        h /= 2
        count += 1
    return count
```

### Problem 3: Robot Cleaner Simulation
**Problem Statement:** A robot cleaner is placed at `(r, c)` and needs to clean a cell `(rd, cd)` by moving along rows and columns. It reflects its direction upon hitting the boundaries. Find out how many steps it takes to reach `(rd, cd)`.

**Solution:**
Simulate the robot's movements using the given rules for boundary reflection and keep counting the steps until the robot reaches the target.

```python
def robot_cleaner_simulation(n, m, rb, cb, rd, cd):
    dr, dc = 1, 1
    time = 0
    while True:
        rb += dr
        cb += dc
        time += 1
        if rb == rd and cb == cd:
            return time
        if rb <= 1 or rb >= n:
            dr = -dr
        if cb <= 1 or cb >= m:
            dc = -dc
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

### Explanation of the Solution:
1. Initialize `dr` and `dc` to 1 (move right and down).
2. Use a loop to simulate the robot's movements until it reaches the target cell `(r_d, c_d)`.
3. Inside the loop, update the robot's position by adding `dr` to `r_b` and `dc` to `c_b`.
4. Increment the time counter by 1 each second.
5. Check for boundary hits and reflect the direction accordingly.
6. Return the total time once the robot reaches the target cell.

### Python3 Code:

```python
def robot_cleaner_time(n, m, rb, cb, rd, cd):
    dr, dc = 1, 1
    time = 0
    
    while True:
        rb += dr
        cb += dc
        time += 1
        
        if rb == rd and cb == cd:
            return time
        
        # Reflect direction if hitting the boundary
        if rb <= 1 or rb >= n:
            dr = -dr
        if cb <= 1 or cb >= m:
            dc = -dc

# Reading input from standard input
import sys
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()

t = int(data[0])
results = []

index = 1
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    m = int(data[index + 1])
    rb = int(data[index + 2]) - 1  # Adjusting to zero-based indexing
    cb = int(data[index + 3]) - 1
    rd = int(data[index + 4]) - 1
    cd = int(data[index + 5]) - 1
    index += 6
    
    result = robot_cleaner_time(n, m, rb, cb, rd, cd)
    results.append(result)

# Writing output to standard output
print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
```

This solution reads the number of test cases and processes each test case according to the provided logic. The robot's movements and reflections are handled efficiently using basic arithmetic operations.
