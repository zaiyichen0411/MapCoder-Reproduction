### Core Concepts and Algorithms

To solve this problem, we need to understand the concept of a recursive sequence with memoization to optimize performance. The Fibonacci-like sequence given is known as the "FibFib" sequence. Each term in the sequence is the sum of the previous three terms:

\[
\text{fibfib}(n) = \text{fibfib}(n-1) + \text{fibfib}(n-2) + \text{fibfib}(n-3)
\]

Since this involves repeated calculations, simply using a straightforward recursive approach would result in exponential time complexity due to redundant calculations. To optimize this, we use memoization, which stores previously computed values and reuses them when needed. This reduces the time complexity to linear.

### Tutorial on Recursive Sequences with Memoization

A **recursive sequence** is a sequence where each term depends on one or more of the preceding terms. A classic example is the Fibonacci sequence, but here we have an extension where each term depends on the previous three terms.

**Memoization** is a technique for storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again. This avoids redundant computations and significantly speeds up the algorithm.

Here¡¯s how you can implement memoization in Python:

1. Define a dictionary to store the computed values.
2. Check if the value for the current input is already in the dictionary. If so, return it.
3. If not, compute the value recursively and store it in the dictionary before returning it.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Climbing Stairs with Three Steps
**Problem Statement:** You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Solution Idea:** Use a bottom-up dynamic programming approach with memoization. Each state `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i-th` step.

**Python Code:**
```python
def climbStairs(n):
    dp = {}
    def helper(i):
        if i <= 1:
            return 1
        if i == 2:
            return 2
        if i in dp:
            return dp[i]
        dp[i] = helper(i-1) + helper(i-2) + helper(i-3)
        return dp[i]
    return helper(n)
```

#### Problem 2: Minimum Cost Climbing Stairs
**Problem Statement:** You are given an array of costs where `cost[i]` is the cost of ith step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps. You can start from either step 0 or step 1. Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

**Solution Idea:** Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each step. The recurrence relation is `dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i]`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def minCostClimbingStairs(cost):
    dp = [0] * (len(cost) + 1)
    for i in range(2, len(dp)):
        dp[i] = min(dp[i-1], dp[i-2]) + cost[i-1]
    return min(dp[-1], dp[-2])
```

#### Problem 3: House Robber II
**Problem Statement:** You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, but adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

**Solution Idea:** Similar to the classical House Robber problem, but here you cannot rob both the first and last houses because they are adjacent. Use dynamic programming to solve two subproblems separately (excluding the first house and excluding the last house) and take the maximum of the two results.

**Python Code:**
```python
def rob(nums):
    def rob_helper(nums):
        if not nums:
            return 0
        elif len(nums) == 1:
            return nums[0]
        dp = [0] * len(nums)
        dp[0] = nums[0]
        dp[1] = max(nums[0], nums[1])
        for i in range(2, len(nums)):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[i-2] + nums[i])
        return dp[-1]
    
    if not nums:
        return 0
    elif len(nums) == 1:
        return nums[0]
    return max(rob_helper(nums[:-1]), rob_helper(nums[1:]))
```

### Python3 code to solve the original problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
To solve the FibFib sequence, we use memoization to store previously calculated values of the sequence. We define a helper function `helper` that computes the FibFib number for a given `n`. If the result is already in the memo dictionary, we return it; otherwise, we calculate it recursively and store it in the dictionary.

#### Python3 Code
```python
def fibfib(n: int) -> int:
    memo = {0: 0, 1: 0, 2: 1}
    
    def helper(n):
        if n in memo:
            return memo[n]
        memo[n] = helper(n-1) + helper(n-2) + helper(n-3)
        return memo[n]
    
    return helper(n)
```

This code ensures that each term in the FibFib sequence is computed only once, making it efficient even for large values of `n`.

## Core Concepts / Algorithms

To solve the `vowels_count` function, we need to implement a method that counts the number of vowels in a given word. The key aspects of this problem are:

1. **Character Comparison**: We need to check each character in the word against a predefined set of vowels.
2. **Case Insensitivity**: The counting should be case-insensitive, meaning both uppercase and lowercase letters should be treated uniformly.
3. **Special Case for 'y'**: 'y' is considered a vowel only if it appears at the end of the word.

We can use a straightforward approach with loops and conditionals to achieve this. Specifically:
- Convert the word to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.
- Iterate through each character in the word.
- Count a character if it is a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') or if it is 'y' and it's the last character.

## Tutorial

### Character Comparison
In Python, we can compare characters using equality operators (`==`). For example, `'a' == 'A'` will return `False`.

### String Conversion
Using the `lower()` method, we can convert a string to all lowercase, making our comparison simpler.

```python
word = "Hello"
lower_word = word.lower()  # Now lower_word is "hello"
```

### Iteration
We can iterate over each character in a string using a `for` loop:

```python
word = "abcde"
for char in word:
    print(char)
```

### Conditional Statements
We use conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`) to make decisions based on conditions:

```python
char = 'a'
if char == 'a':
    print("It's an 'a'")
```

### Combining Concepts
Combining these concepts, we can create a function that counts vowels:

```python
def count_vowels(word):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    count = 0
    for char in word.lower():
        if char in vowels or (char == 'y' and word.endswith('y')):
            count += 1
    return count
```

## Example Problems

### Problem 1: Counting Vowels in a Word
**Problem Description**: Given a word, return the number of vowels in the word.
**Solution**: Use the same logic as above. Here's the code:

```python
def count_vowels(word):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    count = 0
    for char in word.lower():
        if char in vowels or (char == 'y' and word.endswith('y')):
            count += 1
    return count
```

### Problem 2: Counting Vowels in a Sentence
**Problem Description**: Given a sentence, return the total number of vowels in the sentence.
**Solution**: Split the sentence into words and count vowels in each word. Here's the code:

```python
def count_vowels_in_sentence(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    total_vowels = 0
    for word in words:
        total_vowels += count_vowels(word)
    return total_vowels
```

### Problem 3: Counting Vowels in a File
**Problem Description**: Given a file containing multiple lines of text, return the total number of vowels in the file.
**Solution**: Read the file line by line and count vowels in each line. Here's the code:

```python
def count_vowels_in_file(file_path):
    total_vowels = 0
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            total_vowels += count_vowels(line.strip())
    return total_vowels
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

### Explanation of the Solution
The `vowels_count` function works as follows:
1. It converts the input string `s` to lowercase to ensure case insensitivity.
2. It initializes a counter `count` to zero.
3. It iterates through each character in the string.
4. For each character, it checks if it is a vowel or if it is 'y' and the character is the last one in the string.
5. If either condition is met, it increments the counter.
6. Finally, it returns the total count of vowels.

### Python3 Code

```python
def vowels_count(s):
    vowels = ['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']
    count = 0
    s = s.lower()  # Convert to lowercase to handle case insensitivity
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in vowels or (char == 'y' and i == len(s) - 1):
            count += 1
    return count
```

This code correctly implements the required functionality to count vowels in a given word according to the specified rules.

## Core Concepts/Algorithms

The problem requires implementing a circular shift operation on the digits of an integer. The core concept here involves understanding how to handle the shifting of digits and dealing with cases where the shift value exceeds the number of digits in the integer.

### Algorithm Steps:

1. **Convert the Integer to a String**: This allows us to easily manipulate individual digits.
2. **Calculate Effective Shifts**: Since circular shifts can be performed multiple times without changing the outcome (e.g., shifting a 4-digit number four times returns to the original), we need to calculate the effective shift using modulo operation (`shift % len(str(x))`).
3. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If `shift == 0`, the number remains unchanged.
   - If `shift > number of digits`, reverse the digits.
4. **Perform Circular Shift**:
   - Split the string into two parts based on the calculated shift.
   - Concatenate the second part with the first part to achieve the circular shift.
5. **Return the Result**: Convert the shifted string back to an integer and return it as a string.

## Tutorial: Understanding Circular Shifting

Circular shifting involves moving elements within a sequence such that some of them wrap around to the beginning. In this problem, we're dealing with integer digits, but the logic remains similar.

For example, circularly shifting the digits of the number `12345` by one position to the right gives `51234`. If we shift it by five positions, we get back to the original number `12345`.

When the shift is greater than the number of digits, reversing the digits is equivalent to performing a circular shift by the number of positions equal to the remainder when the shift is divided by the number of digits.

## Example Problems

### Problem 1: Rotate Array Elements

**Problem Description**: Rotate an array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

**Solution**: Similar to the given problem, you can calculate the effective rotation using modulo and then perform the rotation.

```python
def rotate_array(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n
    nums[:k], nums[k:] = nums[n-k:], nums[:n-k]
```

### Problem 2: Left Circular Shift of a List

**Problem Description**: Implement a function to left-circular-shift a list by `m` positions.

**Solution**: Use slicing to split the list and recombine it in the desired order.

```python
def left_circular_shift(lst, m):
    m %= len(lst)  # Calculate effective shift
    return lst[m:] + lst[:m]
```

### Problem 3: String Rotation Check

**Problem Description**: Check if one string is a rotation of another string.

**Solution**: A string `b` is a rotation of string `a` if `len(a) == len(b)` and concatenating `a` with itself contains `b`.

```python
def is_rotation(s1, s2):
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return False
    return s2 in (s1 + s1)
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

### Explanation of the Solution

1. Convert the integer `x` to a string.
2. Calculate the effective shift using modulo operation (`shift % len(str(x))`).
3. Handle edge cases:
   - If `shift == 0`, return the original string.
   - If `effective_shift == len(str(x))`, reverse the string.
4. Perform the circular shift by slicing the string and combining the parts.
5. Return the result as a string.

### Python3 Code

```python
def circular_shift(x, shift):
    str_x = str(x)
    n = len(str_x)
    
    if shift == 0:
        return str_x
    
    effective_shift = shift % n
    
    if effective_shift == 0:
        return str_x
    
    if effective_shift == n:
        return str_x[::-1]
    
    shifted_str = str_x[-effective_shift:] + str_x[:-effective_shift]
    return shifted_str

# Test cases
print(circular_shift(12, 1))  # Output: "21"
print(circular_shift(12, 2))  # Output: "12"
```

This code correctly handles both the circular shift and the edge case where the shift is greater than the number of digits, returning the expected results.

### Core Concepts & Algorithms

To solve this problem, we need to identify the following key concepts:
1. **Character Checking**: We need to check if a character is an uppercase letter.
2. **ASCII Code Calculation**: If the character is uppercase, we need to calculate its ASCII value.
3. **Summing Values**: We need to sum up the ASCII values of all uppercase letters in the given string.

We will use Python's built-in functions `isupper()` to check if a character is uppercase and the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value of a character.

### Tutorial

#### Character Checking with `isupper()`
The `isupper()` method checks if a character is an uppercase letter. It returns `True` if the character is uppercase, otherwise `False`.

```python
print('A'.isupper())  # True
print('a'.isupper())  # False
```

#### ASCII Value Calculation with `ord()`
The `ord()` function returns the Unicode code point for a single character.

```python
print(ord('A'))  # 65
print(ord('a'))  # 97
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Uppercase Sum in a String
**Problem Statement**: Given a string, return the sum of ASCII values of all uppercase letters in the string.

**Solution**:
1. Initialize a variable `sum_upper` to store the sum.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
3. Check if the character is uppercase using `isupper()`.
4. If it is, add its ASCII value to `sum_upper`.
5. Return `sum_upper`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def sum_uppercase(s):
    sum_upper = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            sum_upper += ord(char)
    return sum_upper

# Test cases
print(sum_uppercase(""))          # 0
print(sum_uppercase("abAB"))      # 131
print(sum_uppercase("abcCd"))     # 67
print(sum_uppercase("helloE"))    # 69
print(sum_uppercase("woArBld"))   # 131
print(sum_uppercase("aAaaaXa"))   # 153
```

#### Problem 2: Filter Uppercase Characters from a String
**Problem Statement**: Given a string, return a new string containing only the uppercase characters.

**Solution**:
1. Initialize an empty list `result`.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
3. Check if the character is uppercase using `isupper()`.
4. If it is, append it to the `result` list.
5. Join the list into a string and return it.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def filter_uppercase(s):
    result = []
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

# Test cases
print(filter_uppercase(""))          # ""
print(filter_uppercase("abAB"))      # "AB"
print(filter_uppercase("abcCd"))     # "C"
print(filter_uppercase("helloE"))    # "E"
print(filter_uppercase("woArBld"))   # "AB"
print(filter_uppercase("aAaaaXa"))   # "AX"
```

#### Problem 3: Count Uppercase Characters in a String
**Problem Statement**: Given a string, return the count of uppercase characters in the string.

**Solution**:
1. Initialize a counter `count_upper` to zero.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
3. Check if the character is uppercase using `isupper()`.
4. If it is, increment the `count_upper` counter.
5. Return `count_upper`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def count_uppercase(s):
    count_upper = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            count_upper += 1
    return count_upper

# Test cases
print(count_uppercase(""))          # 0
print(count_uppercase("abAB"))      # 2
print(count_uppercase("abcCd"))     # 1
print(count_uppercase("helloE"))    # 1
print(count_uppercase("woArBld"))   # 2
print(count_uppercase("aAaaaXa"))   # 3
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution**:
1. Initialize a variable `sum_upper` to store the sum of ASCII values of uppercase characters.
2. Iterate through each character in the input string `s`.
3. Use `isupper()` to check if the character is uppercase.
4. If it is, use `ord()` to get the ASCII value and add it to `sum_upper`.
5. After iterating through all characters, return `sum_upper`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def digitSum(s):
    sum_upper = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            sum_upper += ord(char)
    return sum_upper

# Test cases
print(digitSum(""))          # 0
print(digitSum("abAB"))      # 131
print(digitSum("abcCd"))     # 67
print(digitSum("helloE"))    # 69
print(digitSum("woArBld"))   # 131
print(digitSum("aAaaaXa"))   # 153

### Core Concepts / Algorithms

The core concept for solving this problem involves basic arithmetic operations and string manipulation. Specifically, we need to extract numerical values from a string, perform subtraction, and return the result. Here are the steps involved:

1. **Extract Numbers from String**: We need to parse the string to find the number of apples and oranges mentioned.
2. **Subtract from Total**: Once we have the counts of apples and oranges, we subtract them from the total number of fruits to get the count of mangoes.

### Tutorial

#### Extracting Numbers from a String

To extract numbers from a string, we can use regular expressions. Python's `re` module provides powerful tools for pattern matching and extracting specific parts of strings.

Here¡¯s how you can extract numbers from a string:

```python
import re

def extract_numbers(text):
    # Use regular expression to find all occurrences of numbers
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text)
    return [int(num) for num in numbers]

text = "5 apples and 6 oranges"
numbers = extract_numbers(text)
print(numbers)  # Output: [5, 6]
```

#### Subtraction and Return

Once we have the numbers extracted, we simply subtract them from the total number of fruits to get the count of mangoes.

```python
total_fruits = 19

### Example Problems

**Problem 1: Number of Digits in a String**

Given a string, return the count of digits present in it.

**Solution**: Use regular expressions to find all digits and count them.

```python
def count_digits(text):
    digits = re.findall(r'\d', text)
    return len(digits)

text = "abc123xyz45"
count = count_digits(text)
print(count)  # Output: 5
```

**Problem 2: Sum of Even Numbers in a List**

Given a list of integers, return the sum of even numbers.

**Solution**: Iterate through the list, check if each number is even, and add it to the sum if it is.

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(lst):
    return sum(x for x in lst if x % 2 == 0)

lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
sum_even = sum_of_even_numbers(lst)
print(sum_even)  # Output: 12
```

**Problem 3: Reversing Words in a Sentence**

Given a sentence, reverse the order of words in it.

**Solution**: Split the sentence into words, reverse the list of words, and join them back together.

```python
def reverse_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    reversed_words = ' '.join(reversed(words))
    return reversed_words

sentence = "hello world from python"
reversed_sentence = reverse_words(sentence)
print(reversed_sentence)  # Output: "python from world hello"
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**: 
1. Extract the numbers of apples and oranges using the `extract_numbers` function.
2. Subtract the sum of apples and oranges from the total number of fruits to get the number of mangoes.

**Python3 Code**:

```python
import re

def extract_numbers(text):
    numbers = re.findall(r'\d+', text)
    return [int(num) for num in numbers]

def fruit_distribution(s, n):
    nums = extract_numbers(s)
    apples = nums[0]
    oranges = nums[1]
    mangoes = n - apples - oranges
    return mangoes

# Test cases
print(fruit_distribution("5 apples and 6 oranges", 19))  # Output: 8
print(fruit_distribution("0 apples and 1 oranges", 3))   # Output: 2
print(fruit_distribution("2 apples and 3 oranges", 100)) # Output: 95
print(fruit_distribution("100 apples and 1 oranges", 120)) # Output: 19
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above and solves the original problem efficiently.

### Algorithms:

The core concept involved in solving this problem is finding the minimum element with a specific property (in this case, the smallest even value) from a given list. To achieve this efficiently, we can iterate through the list once while keeping track of the smallest even value encountered and its corresponding index. This approach ensures that we find the optimal solution in linear time, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.

### Tutorial:

#### Finding Minimum Element with Specific Property

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the smallest even value (`min_even`) and its index (`min_index`).
2. Iterate through the list of numbers.
3. For each number, check if it is even and smaller than the current `min_even`.
4. If it is, update `min_even` and `min_index`.
5. After iterating through the list, check if any even number was found.
6. If not, return an empty list.
7. Otherwise, return a list containing `min_even` and `min_index`.

This method ensures that we efficiently find the desired element in a single pass through the list.

### Example Problems:

#### Problem 1: Find the Minimum Even Number

**Problem Description:** Given an array of integers, find the smallest even number and its index. If there are no even numbers, return -1.

**Solution:** Use a similar approach as described above but initialize `min_even` to infinity and `min_index` to -1. If an even number is found, update `min_even` and `min_index`. Finally, return `min_even` if it was updated, otherwise return -1.

**Python Code:**
```python
def min_even_number(arr):
    min_even = float('inf')
    min_index = -1
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num % 2 == 0 and num < min_even:
            min_even = num
            min_index = i
            
    if min_even == float('inf'):
        return -1
    else:
        return min_even
```

#### Problem 2: Smallest Value in Subarray

**Problem Description:** Given an array and a subarray defined by start and end indices, find the smallest value in the subarray.

**Solution:** Iterate through the subarray and keep track of the minimum value encountered.

**Python Code:**
```python
def smallest_in_subarray(arr, start, end):
    min_val = arr[start]
    for i in range(start + 1, end + 1):
        if arr[i] < min_val:
            min_val = arr[i]
    return min_val
```

#### Problem 3: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

**Problem Description:** Given a sorted array, remove duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once and return the new length of the array.

**Solution:** Use two pointers, one to iterate through the array and another to place the next unique element.

**Python Code:**
```python
def remove_duplicates(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    write_index = 0
    for read_index in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[read_index] != arr[write_index]:
            write_index += 1
            arr[write_index] = arr[read_index]
    
    return write_index + 1
```

### Python3 code to solve the original problem:

#### Explanation of the Solution:

We iterate through the input list `arr`, maintaining two variables: `min_even` to store the smallest even value found and `min_index` to store its index. We initialize `min_even` to infinity and `min_index` to -1. As we iterate, if we encounter an even number that is smaller than `min_even`, we update `min_even` and `min_index`. After the loop, we check if `min_even` was updated. If it was, we return `[min_even, min_index]`; otherwise, we return an empty list.

#### Python3 Code:

```python
def pluck(arr):
    min_even = float('inf')
    min_index = -1
    
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if num % 2 == 0 and num < min_even:
            min_even = num
            min_index = i
            
    if min_even == float('inf'):
        return []
    else:
        return [min_even, min_index]
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above and will work efficiently for the given constraints.

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

The problem involves finding the greatest integer in a list whose frequency is greater than or equal to its value. This requires counting the frequency of each element in the list and then checking each unique element against this condition. The key algorithms here are:

1. **Counting Frequencies**: We need to count how many times each number appears in the list. This can be efficiently done using a dictionary where the keys are the numbers from the list and the values are their counts.

2. **Finding the Greatest Integer**: After obtaining the frequencies, we need to iterate through the dictionary to find the largest integer that satisfies the condition.

3. **Sorting and Comparison**: To find the greatest integer efficiently, we can sort the keys of the dictionary in descending order and check them one by one until we find the first one that meets the condition.

### Tutorial

#### Counting Frequencies with Dictionaries
In Python, dictionaries are very useful for counting occurrences of elements. Here¡¯s how you can do it:
```python
def count_frequencies(lst):
    freq_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        if num in freq_dict:
            freq_dict[num] += 1
        else:
            freq_dict[num] = 1
    return freq_dict
```

#### Finding the Greatest Integer
Once you have the frequencies, you can iterate over the dictionary to find the desired integer:
```python
def find_greatest_integer(freq_dict):
    # Convert keys to a sorted list in descending order
    sorted_keys = sorted(freq_dict.keys(), reverse=True)
    
    for key in sorted_keys:
        if freq_dict[key] >= key:
            return key
    return -1
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Maximum Frequency Element
**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers, return the maximum frequency element.

**Solution**:
- Use a dictionary to count frequencies.
- Find the maximum frequency and return the corresponding element.

**Python Code**:
```python
def max_frequency_element(arr):
    freq_dict = {}
    for num in arr:
        freq_dict[num] = freq_dict.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    max_freq = max(freq_dict.values())
    for num, freq in freq_dict.items():
        if freq == max_freq:
            return num
    return None
```

#### Problem 2: Minimum Frequency Element
**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers, return the minimum frequency element.

**Solution**:
- Use a dictionary to count frequencies.
- Find the minimum frequency and return the corresponding element.

**Python Code**:
```python
def min_frequency_element(arr):
    freq_dict = {}
    for num in arr:
        freq_dict[num] = freq_dict.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    min_freq = min(freq_dict.values())
    for num, freq in freq_dict.items():
        if freq == min_freq:
            return num
    return None
```

#### Problem 3: Most Frequent K Elements
**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers and an integer k, return the most frequent k elements.

**Solution**:
- Use a dictionary to count frequencies.
- Sort the dictionary by frequency and return the top k elements.

**Python Code**:
```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def most_frequent_k_elements(arr, k):
    freq_dict = Counter(arr)
    most_common = freq_dict.most_common(k)
    return [item[0] for item in most_common]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
- We use a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the list.
- We sort the keys of the dictionary in descending order.
- We iterate over the sorted keys and check if the frequency of any key is greater than or equal to its value.
- We return the first key that satisfies the condition or -1 if no such key exists.

**Python Code**:
```python
def search(lst):
    freq_dict = {}
    for num in lst:
        freq_dict[num] = freq_dict.get(num, 0) + 1
    
    sorted_keys = sorted(freq_dict.keys(), reverse=True)
    
    for key in sorted_keys:
        if freq_dict[key] >= key:
            return key
    return -1
```

This code should work correctly for the given problem and handle all edge cases as described in the examples.

### Algorithms

The core concept for solving this problem involves the use of two main operations:
1. **Sorting**: To easily access the smallest and largest elements in the list.
2. **Alternating Min-Max Selection**: To create the "strange" order by alternating between selecting the minimum and maximum values from the sorted list.

### Tutorial

#### Sorting
Sorting is an algorithm that arranges a collection of items into a specific order. In Python, the `sorted()` function is commonly used for sorting lists.

#### Alternating Min-Max Selection
To achieve the "strange" sorting order, we need to repeatedly select the smallest and largest elements from the list and append them to a new list until all elements have been selected. This can be done using a loop where we alternate between popping the first (minimum) and last (maximum) elements from the sorted list.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Smallest and Largest Elements
**Problem:** Given a list of integers, return a tuple containing the smallest and largest elements.
**Solution:** Use the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions.
```python
def find_min_max(lst):
    return (min(lst), max(lst))
```

#### Problem 2: Alternate Sort
**Problem:** Given a list of integers, return a list sorted in a way that alternates between the smallest and largest remaining elements.
**Solution:** Create a copy of the list, sort it, and then alternately pop the smallest and largest elements.
```python
def alternate_sort(lst):
    lst_copy = lst[:]
    result = []
    lst_copy.sort()
    while lst_copy:
        result.append(lst_copy.pop(0))  # Pop the smallest element
        if lst_copy:
            result.append(lst_copy.pop())  # Pop the largest element
    return result
```

#### Problem 3: Strange Sort with Duplicates
**Problem:** Given a list of integers that may contain duplicates, return a list sorted in a "strange" order as described.
**Solution:** Similar to the original problem but ensure that duplicates are handled correctly by not removing them from the original list.
```python
def strange_sort_with_duplicates(lst):
    result = []
    while lst:
        result.append(min(lst))
        lst.remove(min(lst))
        if lst:
            result.append(max(lst))
            lst.remove(max(lst))
    return result
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution:**
1. **Sort the List**: Start by sorting the input list.
2. **Initialize Result List**: Create an empty list to store the result.
3. **Alternate Min-Max Selection**: Use a loop to alternately pop the smallest and largest elements from the sorted list and append them to the result list.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def strange_sort_list(lst):
    '''
    Given list of integers, return list in strange order.
    Strange sorting, is when you start with the minimum value,
    then maximum of the remaining integers, then minimum and so on.

    Examples:
    strange_sort_list([1, 2, 3, 4]) == [1, 4, 2, 3]
    strange_sort_list([5, 5, 5, 5]) == [5, 5, 5, 5]
    strange_sort_list([]) == []
    '''
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst)
    result = []
    while sorted_lst:
        result.append(sorted_lst.pop(0))  # Pop the smallest element
        if sorted_lst:
            result.append(sorted_lst.pop())  # Pop the largest element
    return result
```

This code snippet sorts the input list and then alternates between appending the smallest and largest elements to the result list until all elements have been processed.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept for solving this problem involves understanding basic geometry and validating whether the given sides can form a triangle. The main steps are:
1. Check if the given sides can form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.
2. If they do form a valid triangle, calculate its area using Heron's formula.
3. Round the calculated area to two decimal places.

## Tutorial:
### Triangle Inequality Theorem:
This theorem states that for any three sides to form a triangle, the sum of the lengths of any two sides must be greater than the length of the remaining side. Mathematically, if the sides are \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), then:
\[ a + b > c \]
\[ a + c > b \]
\[ b + c > a \]

### Heron's Formula:
If the sides of a triangle are known, we can calculate its area using Heron's formula. First, compute the semi-perimeter \(s\) of the triangle:
\[ s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \]
Then, the area \(A\) is given by:
\[ A = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)} \]

    if a + b <= c or a + c <= b or b + c <= a:
        return -1
    s = (a + b + c) / 2

### Problem 2: [Codeforces - Problem 505D: Triangle with Perimeter P](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/505/D)
**Description**: Given the perimeter \(P\) and the number of triangles required, find the maximum possible area of a single triangle.
**Solution**: This involves iterating over possible side lengths while ensuring the triangle is valid and calculating the area using Heron's formula.

    max_area = -1
    for a in range(1, P // 3 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (P - a) // 2 + 1):

            if a + b > c:
                s = (a + b + c) / 2
                area = math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c))

**Description**: Players take turns from a pile of stones. On each turn, a player removes between 1 and 3 stones. The winner is the one with the most stones at the end.
**Solution**: This problem requires dynamic programming, but the core idea is similar to choosing the best strategy based on the current state of the game, which can involve considering different scenarios.
```python
def stoneGameIII(stoneValue):
    n = len(stoneValue)
    dp = [-float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 0

        take = 0
        for j in range(i, min(i + 3, n)):
            take += stoneValue[j]

    return "Alice" if dp[0] > 0 else ("Bob" if dp[0] < 0 else "Tie")
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Triangle Validity Check**: Ensure the given sides satisfy the triangle inequality theorem.
2. **Calculate Semi-perimeter**: Compute \(s\) as \((a + b + c) / 2\).
3. **Calculate Area Using Heron's Formula**: Apply the formula to get the area.
4. **Round the Result**: Round the area to two decimal places.

### Core Concepts/Algorithms

To solve this problem, we need to identify how many changes are required to make an array palindromic. The key insight is to compare elements from the start and end of the array moving towards the center. If the elements at corresponding positions are different, we need to change one of them to match the other. 

The algorithm involves:
1. Initialize two pointers, one starting at the beginning (`i = 0`) and one at the end (`j = len(arr) - 1`).
2. Iterate while `i < j`, comparing the elements at `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.
3. If the elements are not equal, increment a counter since one change will be needed.
4. Move both pointers inward (`i += 1` and `j -= 1`).
5. Return the count of changes needed.

### Tutorial on Palindrome Checking

A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward. To check if an array is a palindrome, we can use the two-pointer technique described above. This method ensures that we only need to traverse half of the array.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Set two pointers, `left` to 0 and `right` to the last index of the array.
2. **Traversal**: While `left < right`:
   - Compare the elements at `arr[left]` and `arr[right]`.
   - If they are not equal, return `False` because the array cannot be a palindrome.
   - Increment `left` and decrement `right`.
3. **Completion**: If the loop completes without finding any mismatched pairs, return `True`.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: [Valid Palindrome II]
**Description**: Given a string, determine if it is possible to make the string a palindrome by deleting at most one character.
**Solution**: Use the two-pointer approach with a slight modification to allow for one deletion.

```python
def validPalindrome(s):
    def isValid(left, right):
        while left < right:
            if s[left] != s[right]:
                return False
            left += 1
            right -= 1
        return True
    
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            # Try removing either the left or right character
            return isValid(left + 1, right) or isValid(left, right - 1)
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

#### Problem 2: [Minimum Insertions to Form Palindrome]
**Description**: Given a string, find the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted to make the string a palindrome.
**Solution**: Use dynamic programming to build a table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum insertions needed to convert the substring `s[i:j+1]` into a palindrome.

```python
def minInsertions(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for gap in range(1, n):
        for i in range(n - gap):
            j = i + gap
            if s[i] == s[j]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + 1
                
    return dp[0][n - 1]
```

#### Problem 3: [Longest Palindromic Substring]
**Description**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring.
**Solution**: Expand around centers to find all possible palindromes.

```python
def longestPalindrome(s):
    if not s:
        return ""
    
    def expandAroundCenter(left, right):
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return s[left + 1:right]
    
    result = ""
    for i in range(len(s)):
        odd = expandAroundCenter(i, i)
        even = expandAroundCenter(i, i + 1)
        longer = odd if len(odd) > len(even) else even
        if len(longer) > len(result):
            result = longer
            
    return result
```

### Solution to the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
The function `smallest_change` uses a two-pointer approach to count the number of changes needed to make the array palindromic. We iterate from both ends of the array towards the center, counting mismatches which indicate necessary changes.

#### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

```python
def smallest_change(arr):
    i, j = 0, len(arr) - 1
    changes = 0
    
    while i < j:
        if arr[i] != arr[j]:
            changes += 1
        i += 1
        j -= 1
        
    return changes
```

This code efficiently determines the minimum number of changes required by leveraging the two-pointer technique.

### Algorithms:
To solve this problem, we need to identify whether a given number \(a\) (where \(a < 100\)) can be expressed as the product of exactly three prime numbers. The core concept here involves checking for prime factors of the number and counting them until we reach exactly three.

### Tutorial:
#### Prime Number Check:
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if a number is prime, you can iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number and check if any of these values divide the number evenly.

#### Counting Prime Factors:
To count the prime factors of a number, you can repeatedly divide the number by its smallest prime factor until it becomes 1. Each division corresponds to finding a prime factor.

### Example Problems:
1. **Problem:** [UVA - 11741 - Find the Primitive Root]

   - **Description:** Given an array of integers, find the largest component size by common factor.
   - **Solution:** This problem requires identifying all prime factors of each number and grouping them accordingly.
   
3. **Problem:** [Codeforces - 560D - Divisibility by Powers of Two]
   - **Description:** Determine how many times a number can be divided by powers of two.
   - **Solution:** The solution involves counting the prime factors (specifically, counting the power of 2).

# Test cases
print(is_multiply_prime(30))  # True
print(is_multiply_prime(8))   # False

```

### Explanation of the Solution:

## Algorithms

To solve this problem, we need to determine whether a given number \( x \) is a simple power of another number \( n \). This means checking if there exists an integer \( k \) such that \( n^k = x \).

### Steps:
1. **Check for Edge Cases**: If \( x \) is 1, then it should always return `True` because \( n^0 = 1 \) for any \( n \neq 0 \).
2. **Iterate Over Possible Powers**: Start with \( k = 0 \) and keep increasing \( k \) until \( n^k \) exceeds \( x \).
3. **Comparison**: At each step, check if \( n^k = x \). If so, return `True`. If \( n^k > x \), return `False`.

## Tutorial

### Binary Exponentiation
The concept of binary exponentiation can be used to efficiently compute \( n^k \). Instead of multiplying \( n \) by itself \( k \) times, which takes \( O(k) \) time, binary exponentiation reduces the time complexity to \( O(\log k) \).

#### How It Works:
- Express \( k \) in binary form.
- Compute powers of \( n \) iteratively, squaring them at each step.
- Multiply the result by \( n \) whenever the corresponding bit in \( k \) is 1.

Example:
- To compute \( 2^6 \):
  - \( k = 6 = 110_2 \)
  - Start with \( res = 1 \)
  - Square \( 2 \) to get \( 4 \) (since \( 2^1 = 2 \))
  - Square \( 4 \) to get \( 16 \) (since \( 2^2 = 4 \))
  - Since the second bit is 0, do not multiply by \( 2 \)
  - Result is \( 16 \)

## Example Problems

### Problem 1: Power of Three
**Problem Statement**: Check if a given number \( n \) is a power of 3.
**Solution**: Use binary exponentiation starting from \( 3^0 \) and keep multiplying by 3 until the result exceeds \( n \).
```python
def is_power_of_three(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    current = 1
    while current <= n:
        if current == n:
            return True
        current *= 3
    return False
```

### Problem 2: Smallest Power of Two Greater Than N
**Problem Statement**: Find the smallest power of two greater than or equal to \( n \).
**Solution**: Use binary exponentiation to find the smallest \( k \) such that \( 2^k \geq n \).
```python
def smallest_power_of_two(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return 1
    k = 0
    current = 1
    while current < n:
        current *= 2
        k += 1
    return current
```

### Problem 3: Is Simple Power of Any Number
**Problem Statement**: Check if a given number \( x \) is a simple power of any number \( n \) (i.e., there exists some \( n \) and \( k \) such that \( n^k = x \)).
**Solution**: Try all possible values of \( n \) and use binary exponentiation to check if \( n^k = x \) for some integer \( k \).
```python
def is_any_simple_power(x):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    for n in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
        current = 1
        k = 0
        while current <= x:
            if current == x:
                return True
            current *= n
            k += 1
    return False
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

### Explanation of the Solution
The solution involves iterating over possible bases \( n \) and using binary exponentiation to check if \( n^k = x \) for some integer \( k \). We stop when \( n \) becomes too large relative to \( x \).

### Python3 Code
```python
def is_simple_power(x, n):
    if x == 1:
        return True
    current = 1
    k = 0
    while current <= x:
        if current == x:
            return True
        current *= n
        k += 1
    return False
```

This code checks if \( x \) is a simple power of \( n \) by comparing \( n^k \) with \( x \) as \( k \) increases. If \( n^k = x \) for some \( k \), it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution:

## Algorithms:
The core concept for solving this problem is to determine whether a given integer \(a\) is a perfect cube. This involves checking if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(x^3 = a\). 

To achieve this, we can use the mathematical property that the cube root of a number will give us the integer value if the number is a perfect cube. We will calculate the cube root of the absolute value of \(a\) (since cubes can be negative), round it to the nearest integer, and then check if cubing this integer gives back the original number \(a\).

## Tutorial:
### Cube Root Calculation:
The cube root of a number \(a\) is a number \(x\) such that \(x^3 = a\). In Python, we can use the `**(1/3)` operator to compute the cube root of a number. However, since cube roots of negative numbers can be negative, we need to handle this case separately.

### Rounding:
When dealing with floating-point arithmetic, we need to round the cube root to the nearest integer because the cube of an integer should exactly match \(a\). The `round()` function in Python helps with this task.

### Checking the Cube:
After rounding, we cube the result and check if it matches the original number \(a\). If it does, then \(a\) is a perfect cube.

## Example Problems:
### Problem 1: [UVA Online Judge - 10277 - Is It A Cube?]
Given a number, determine if it is a perfect cube.

**Solution:**
We use the same approach as described above. Compute the cube root, round it, and check if cubing the rounded value gives back the original number.

```python
def is_cube(n):
    root = round(abs(n) ** (1/3))
    return root ** 3 == n

# Test cases
print(is_cube(1))   # True
print(is_cube(2))   # False
print(is_cube(-1))  # True
print(is_cube(64))  # True
print(is_cube(0))   # True
print(is_cube(180)) # False
```

### Problem 2: [LeetCode - 1193. Transpose Matrix]
Given a matrix, transpose it.

**Solution:** This problem doesn't directly involve cubes but demonstrates array manipulation skills which are useful in many types of programming tasks.

```python
def transpose(matrix):
    return [[matrix[j][i] for j in range(len(matrix))] for i in range(len(matrix[0]))]

# Test cases
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
print(transpose(matrix))
```

### Problem 3: [Codeforces - 77A - Way Too Long Words]
Given a list of words, replace all words longer than 10 characters with the first character followed by the length of the word minus two and the last character.

**Solution:** This problem requires string manipulation and conditional checks, which are fundamental skills in competitive programming.

```python
def shorten_words(words):
    return [''.join([w[0], str(len(w)-2), w[-1]]) if len(w) > 10 else w for w in words]

# Test cases
words = ["word", "localization", "internationalization"]
print(shorten_words(words))
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
### Explanation:
- Calculate the cube root of the absolute value of \(a\) using `abs(a) ** (1/3)`.
- Round the result to the nearest integer using `round()`.
- Cube the rounded value and check if it equals \(a\).
- Return `True` if they are equal, otherwise return `False`.

### Python3 Code:

### Python3 code to solve the original problem:
#### Solution Explanation:
1. Define a set of prime hexadecimal digits.
2. Iterate through the input string and count the occurrences of these prime digits.
3. Return the count.

```python
def hex_key(num):
    """You have been tasked to write a function that receives 
    a hexadecimal number as a string and counts the number of hexadecimal 
    digits that are primes (prime number, or a prime, is a natural number 
    greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers).
    Hexadecimal digits are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F.
    Prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17,...
    So you have to determine a number of the following digits: 2, 3, 5, 7, 
    B (=decimal 11), D (=decimal 13).
    Note: you may assume the input is always correct or empty string, 
    and symbols A,B,C,D,E,F are always uppercase.
    Examples:
    For num = "AB" the output should be 1.
    For num = "1077E" the output should be 2.
    For num = "ABED1A33" the output should be 4.
    For num = "123456789ABCDEF0" the output should be 6.
    For num = "2020" the output should be 2.
    """
    # Set of prime hexadecimal digits
    prime_hex_digits = {'2', '3', '5', '7', 'B', 'D'}
    
    # Count and return the number of prime hexadecimal digits in the input string
    return sum(1 for char in num if char in prime_hex_digits)
```

This solution efficiently counts the prime hexadecimal digits by leveraging a set for quick membership testing and iterating through the input string once.

## Algorithms:
The core concept for solving this problem is understanding how to convert a decimal number to its binary representation. This involves repeatedly dividing the number by 2 and keeping track of the remainders, which represent the binary digits (bits).

## Tutorial:
### Binary Conversion Process:
1. **Divide**: Divide the decimal number by 2.
2. **Record**: Write down the remainder.
3. **Repeat**: Use the quotient from the division as the new number to divide by 2 until you get a quotient of 0.
4. **Binary Representation**: The binary number is constructed from the remainders, read from bottom to top (last remainder to first remainder).

For example, converting the decimal number 15 to binary:
- 15 ¡Â 2 = 7 remainder 1
- 7 ¡Â 2 = 3 remainder 1
- 3 ¡Â 2 = 1 remainder 1
- 1 ¡Â 2 = 0 remainder 1

Reading the remainders from bottom to top gives us the binary number `1111`.

## Example Problems: 

1. **Problem:** Convert a decimal number to binary without formatting.
   - **Solution:** Implement the conversion algorithm directly without adding the 'db' prefix and suffix.
   - **Code:** 
     ```python
     def decimal_to_binary_no_format(decimal):
         if decimal == 0:
             return "0"
         binary = ""
         while decimal > 0:
             binary = str(decimal % 2) + binary
             decimal //= 2
         return binary
     ```

2. **Problem:** Convert a decimal number to binary with a space between bits.
   - **Solution:** Similar to the original problem but add spaces between the binary digits.
   - **Code:** 
     ```python
     def decimal_to_binary_with_spaces(decimal):
         if decimal == 0:
             return "0"
         binary = ""
         while decimal > 0:
             binary = str(decimal % 2) + binary
             decimal //= 2
         return " ".join(binary)
     ```

3. **Problem:** Convert a decimal number to binary and reverse the result.
   - **Solution:** Convert the decimal to binary and then reverse the resulting string.
   - **Code:** 
     ```python
     def decimal_to_binary_reversed(decimal):
         if decimal == 0:
             return "0"
         binary = ""
         while decimal > 0:
             binary = str(decimal % 2) + binary
             decimal //= 2
         return binary[::-1]
     ```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
The solution involves using a loop to repeatedly divide the decimal number by 2 and prepend the remainder to a string. Finally, we add 'db' at the beginning and the end of the resulting binary string.

### Python3 Code:
```python
def decimal_to_binary(decimal):
    """Converts a decimal number to binary format with 'db' prefix and suffix."""
    if decimal == 0:
        return "db0db"
    
    binary = ""
    while decimal > 0:
        binary = str(decimal % 2) + binary
        decimal //= 2
    
    return f"db{binary}db"

# Test cases
print(decimal_to_binary(15))  # Output: db1111db
print(decimal_to_binary(32))  # Output: db100000db
```

This code correctly converts a decimal number to binary and formats it as required by prepending and appending 'db'.
db1111db
db100000db

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
### Algorithms:
To determine if a string is "happy," we need to check two conditions:
1. The length of the string should be at least 3.
2. Every set of three consecutive characters should be distinct.

This involves iterating through the string and comparing each character with the next two characters to ensure they are all different.

### Tutorial:
**Algorithm Overview:**
1. **Check Length:** First, we need to check if the length of the string is less than 3. If it is, return `False` immediately because a happy string requires at least three characters.
2. **Iterate Through String:** Use a loop to iterate through the string from the start up to the third last character. This ensures that there are always three consecutive characters to compare.
3. **Compare Characters:** For each position in the loop, check if the current character, the next character, and the one after that are all distinct. If any pair of these characters are the same, return `False`.
4. **Return Result:** If the loop completes without finding any non-distinct triplets, return `True`.

**Example Walkthrough:**
Consider the string `"abcd"`:
- Length is 4 (greater than 3).
- Check triplet "abc": All characters are distinct.
- Check triplet "bcd": All characters are distinct.
Since all triplets are distinct, the function returns `True`.

  def collatz_sequence(n):
      while n != 1:
          print(n, end=' ')
          if n % 2 == 0:
              n = n // 2

- **Python Code:**
  ```python
  def gameplay(n):
      return "Alice" if n % 2 != 0 else "Bob"
  ```

### Python3 code to solve the original problem:
**Explanation of the Solution:**
The solution involves checking if the string's length is at least 3 and then verifying that no three consecutive characters are the same. We use a for loop to iterate through the string and compare each character with the next two. If any triplet contains duplicate characters, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding duplicates, the function returns `True`.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def is_happy(s):
    # Check if the length of the string is less than 3
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    
    # Iterate through the string from the start up to the third last character
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        # Check if the current character, the next character, and the one after that are all distinct
        if s[i] == s[i+1] or s[i] == s[i+2] or s[i+1] == s[i+2]:
            return False
    
    # If no non-distinct triplets are found, return True
    return True

# Test cases
print(is_happy("a"))       # Output: False
print(is_happy("aa"))      # Output: False
print(is_happy("abcd"))    # Output: True
print(is_happy("aabb"))    # Output: False
print(is_happy("adb"))     # Output: True
print(is_happy("xyy"))     # Output: False
```

This code correctly implements the logic to determine if a string is "happy" based on the given criteria.

## Algorithms:
The core concept involved in solving this problem is conditional logic, specifically using if-elif-else statements to map input values to corresponding outputs based on specified conditions. This involves iterating over a list of inputs and applying a series of rules to determine the corresponding output for each element.

## Tutorial:
### Conditional Logic in Python:
Conditional logic allows you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Python, this is achieved using `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements. Here's a brief overview:

- **if**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **elif**: Short for "else if," executes a block of code if any preceding `if` or `elif` conditions were false but a new condition is true.
- **else**: Executes a block of code if none of the preceding conditions were true.

Example:
```python
x = 10
if x > 20:
    print("x is greater than 20")
elif x > 10:
    print("x is greater than 10 but not greater than 20")
else:
    print("x is less than or equal to 10")
```

In this example, since `x` is 10, the first two conditions (`x > 20` and `x > 10`) are false, so the program prints "x is less than or equal to 10".

## Example Problems:
### Problem 1: Grade Calculation
**Problem Description:** Write a function that takes a list of scores and returns a list of letter grades based on the following scale:
- 90-100: A
- 80-89: B
- 70-79: C
- 60-69: D
- Below 60: F

**Solution:** Use if-elif-else statements to map scores to grades.

**Python Code:**
```python
def calculate_grades(scores):
    grades = []
    for score in scores:
        if score >= 90:
            grades.append('A')
        elif score >= 80:
            grades.append('B')
        elif score >= 70:
            grades.append('C')
        elif score >= 60:
            grades.append('D')
        else:
            grades.append('F')
    return grades

print(calculate_grades([92, 85, 76, 65, 55]))  # Output: ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F']
```

### Problem 2: Binary Search
**Problem Description:** Implement a binary search algorithm to find the index of an element in a sorted list.

**Solution:** Use binary search to efficiently locate an element in a sorted list.

**Python Code:**
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return -1

print(binary_search([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: 2
```

### Problem 3: Counting Words in a Sentence
**Problem Description:** Write a function that counts the number of words in a given sentence.

**Solution:** Split the sentence into words and count them.

**Python Code:**
```python
def count_words(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    return len(words)

print(count_words("Hello world"))  # Output: 2
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
We need to map a list of GPAs to their corresponding letter grades. We use a combination of if-elif-else statements to check each GPA against the given thresholds and assign the appropriate letter grade.

        elif gpa > 2.0:
            letter_grades.append('C+')
        elif gpa > 1.7:
            letter_grades.append('C')
        elif gpa > 1.3:
            letter_grades.append('C-')
        elif gpa > 1.0:
            letter_grades.append('D+')
        elif gpa > 0.7:
            letter_grades.append('D')
        elif gpa > 0.0:
            letter_grades.append('D-')

# Test the function
print(numerical_letter_grade([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]))  # Output: ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']

### Core Concepts

1. **Prime Number Check**: A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. **String Length Calculation**: The length of a string can be obtained using the `len()` function in Python.

### Algorithm

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Calculate the length of the given string.
2. Check if this length is a prime number.
3. Return `True` if it is a prime number, otherwise return `False`.

### Tutorial

#### Prime Number Check

A number \( n \) is prime if:
- It is greater than 1.
- It has no divisors other than 1 and \( n \).

We can check if a number \( n \) is prime by iterating from 2 to \( \sqrt{n} \) and checking if \( n \) is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is divisible by any number, it is not prime.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

#### String Length Calculation

The length of a string can be calculated using the `len()` function.

```python
string = "example"
length = len(string)
print(length)  # Output: 7
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Counting Prime Length Strings

**Problem Statement**: Given an array of strings, count how many strings have a prime length.

**Solution**:
1. Iterate through the array of strings.
2. For each string, calculate its length.
3. Check if the length is a prime number.
4. Maintain a counter for strings with prime lengths.

```python
def count_prime_length_strings(strings):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    count = 0
    for s in strings:
        if is_prime(len(s)):
            count += 1
    return count
```

#### Problem 2: Longest Palindrome Substring with Prime Length

**Problem Statement**: Given a string, find the longest substring that is a palindrome and has a prime length.

**Solution**:
1. Generate all possible substrings of the string.
2. Check if each substring is a palindrome.
3. Check if the length of the substring is a prime number.
4. Keep track of the longest such substring.

```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

def longest_prime_length_palindrome(s):
    max_len = 0
    result = ""
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
            sub = s[i:j]
            if is_palindrome(sub) and is_prime(len(sub)):

#### Problem 3: Sum of Prime Lengths

**Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, calculate the sum of the lengths of the prime-length subarrays.

**Solution**:
1. Iterate through all possible subarrays.
2. Check if the length of each subarray is a prime number.
3. Sum up the lengths of all such subarrays.

```python
def sum_of_prime_length_subarrays(arr):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    total_sum = 0
    n = len(arr)
    
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start + 1, n + 1):
            subarray = arr[start:end]
            if is_prime(len(subarray)):
                total_sum += len(subarray)
                
    return total_sum
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
1. Calculate the length of the input string using `len()`.
2. Check if the length is a prime number using the `is_prime` helper function.
3. Return `True` if it is a prime number, otherwise return `False`.

**Python3 Code**:

```python
import math

def prime_length(string):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    return is_prime(len(string))
```

This code defines a function `prime_length` that checks whether the length of the input string is a prime number. It uses a nested function `is_prime` to determine if a number is prime by checking divisibility up to the square root of the number.

### Core Concepts

The problem requires counting \( n \)-digit positive integers that either start or end with the digit '1'. To solve this, we need to use combinatorial mathematics to account for both starting and ending conditions without double-counting numbers that both start and end with '1'.

### Algorithms

1. **Counting Principle**: This principle states that if there are \( m \) ways to do one thing and \( n \) ways to do another, then there are \( m \times n \) ways to do both.
2. **Inclusion-Exclusion Principle**: This principle helps avoid over-counting by adding back elements that were subtracted too many times. In our case, we add back numbers that both start and end with '1'.

### Tutorial

#### Counting Principle

Imagine you have two tasks: choosing the first digit and choosing the last digit of an \( n \)-digit number. If there are 9 choices for the first digit (1 through 9) and 10 choices for each of the remaining \( n-2 \) digits, the total number of such numbers would be:

\[ 9 \times 10^{n-2} \]

However, this counts numbers that both start and end with '1' multiple times.

#### Inclusion-Exclusion Principle

To correct for over-counting, we subtract the cases where the number both starts and ends with '1'. There are 10 choices for each of the remaining \( n-2 \) digits:

\[ 10^{n-2} \]

So, the formula becomes:

\[ 9 \times 10^{n-2} - 10^{n-2} = 8 \times 10^{n-2} \]

### Example Problems

1. **Problem**: [LeetCode 677. Map Sum Pairs]
   - **Solution**: Use a Trie data structure to efficiently store and query prefix sums.
   
2. **Problem**: [Codeforces 148A. Wrong Subtraction]
   - **Solution**: Perform repeated subtraction until the result is less than or equal to zero.
   
3. **Problem**: [HackerRank Counting Valleys]
   - **Solution**: Traverse the path using elevation changes to count valleys.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:

We use the formula derived from the inclusion-exclusion principle to count \( n \)-digit numbers that start or end with '1'. We handle special cases when \( n \) is 1 separately since the number itself must be '1'.

```python
def starts_one_ends(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return 8 * pow(10, n - 2)
```

This function calculates the count based on whether \( n \) is 1 or greater, ensuring we don't double-count numbers that start and end with '1'.
