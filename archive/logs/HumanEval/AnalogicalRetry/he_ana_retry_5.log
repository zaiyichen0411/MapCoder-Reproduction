### Core Concepts:

1. **Summation**: The first step involves calculating the sum of the digits of the given number `N`.
2. **Binary Conversion**: After obtaining the sum of the digits, the next step is to convert this sum into its binary representation.

### Tutorial:

#### Summation:
Summing the digits of a number involves iterating through each digit of the number, converting it from string to integer, and adding them up.

#### Binary Conversion:
Converting a decimal number to its binary form can be done using built-in functions like `bin()` which returns the binary representation as a string prefixed with '0b'. To get rid of the prefix, we slice the string starting from index 2.

### Example Problems:

#### Example 1: [Sum of Digits]
**Problem**: Given an integer `N`, find the sum of its digits.
**Solution**: Iterate through each digit, convert it to integer, and add them up.
```python
def sum_of_digits(N):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
```

#### Example 2: [Convert to Binary]
**Problem**: Convert a decimal number to its binary representation without the '0b' prefix.
**Solution**: Use the `bin()` function and slice off the prefix.
```python
def to_binary(n):
    return bin(n)[2:]
```

#### Example 3: [Sum of Digits and Convert to Binary]
**Problem**: Given an integer `N`, calculate the sum of its digits and then convert this sum to its binary representation.
**Solution**: Combine the two steps above.
```python
def sum_and_convert_to_binary(N):
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    return bin(digit_sum)[2:]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. Calculate the sum of the digits of `N` by iterating through each character of the string representation of `N`, converting it to an integer, and summing them up.
2. Convert the resulting sum to its binary representation using the `bin()` function and slice off the '0b' prefix.

#### Python3 Code:
```python
def solve(N):
    # Step 1: Calculate the sum of the digits
    digit_sum = sum(int(digit) for digit in str(N))
    
    # Step 2: Convert the sum to binary and remove the '0b' prefix
    binary_representation = bin(digit_sum)[2:]
    
    return binary_representation
```

### Core Concepts and Algorithm

The problem requires summing up the even elements located at odd indices in a given list of integers. The key concepts involved are:

1. **List Indexing**: Understanding how to access elements in a list using their indices.
2. **Conditional Statements**: Checking if an element meets certain criteria (e.g., being even).
3. **Iteration**: Looping through the list to process each element.

### Tutorial on List Indexing and Conditional Statements

**List Indexing**: In Python, lists are zero-indexed, meaning the first element has index `0`, the second element has index `1`, and so on. To access an element in a list, you can use its index. For example:
```python
lst = [4, 2, 6, 7]
print(lst[0])  # Output: 4
```

**Conditional Statements**: Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on whether a condition is true or false. Common conditional operators include `==` (equals), `!=` (not equals), `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or equal to), and `>=` (greater than or equal to). For example:
```python
x = 5
if x > 0:
    print("Positive number")
else:
    print("Non-positive number")
```

### Example Problems

**Problem 1**: Find the maximum even number in a list.
- **Solution**: Iterate through the list, check if a number is even and greater than the current maximum.
- **Python Code**:
```python
def max_even(lst):
    max_num = float('-inf')
    for num in lst:
        if num % 2 == 0 and num > max_num:
            max_num = num
    return max_num

print(max_even([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 6
```

**Problem 2**: Remove all occurrences of a specific value from a list.
- **Solution**: Create a new list and append only those elements that do not match the specified value.
- **Python Code**:
```python
def remove_value(lst, value):
    return [num for num in lst if num != value]

print(remove_value([4, 2, 6, 2], 2))  # Output: [4, 6]
```

**Problem 3**: Reverse a string without using slicing.
- **Solution**: Use a loop to construct the reversed string character by character.
- **Python Code**:
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_str = ''
    for char in s:
        reversed_str = char + reversed_str
    return reversed_str

print(reverse_string("hello"))  # Output: "olleh"
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**: We need to iterate through the list, checking both the index and the value of each element. If the index is odd (`index % 2 != 0`) and the value is even (`value % 2 == 0`), we add it to our sum.

**Python Code**:
```python
def add(lst):
    total = 0
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            total += lst[i]
    return total

print(add([4, 2, 6, 7]))  # Output: 2
```

This code correctly sums up the even elements that are at odd indices in the given list.

### Core Concepts

The core concept involved in solving this problem is **sorting**. Specifically, we need to sort each word in the input string while maintaining the order of words and spaces. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Splitting the String**: We start by splitting the input string into individual words. This can be done using the `split()` method, which splits a string into a list of words separated by whitespace.
2. **Sorting Each Word**: For each word, we convert it into a list of characters, sort the list, and then join the sorted characters back into a string.
3. **Reconstructing the Sentence**: After sorting each word, we reconstruct the original sentence by joining the sorted words with spaces in between.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Sort Characters in a String

**Problem Description**: You are given a string, and you need to sort its characters in ascending ASCII order.

**Solution**: Split the string into characters, sort them, and join them back together.

```python
def sort_string(s):
    return ''.join(sorted(s))

# Test
print(sort_string("hello"))  # Output: "ehllo"
```

#### Problem 2: Sort Words in a Sentence

**Problem Description**: You are given a sentence, and you need to sort each word in the sentence while keeping the order of words and spaces.

**Solution**: Split the sentence into words, sort each word, and join them back together with spaces.

```python
def sort_sentence(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Test
print(sort_sentence("Hello World!!!"))  # Output: "Hello !!!Wdlor"
```

#### Problem 3: Sort Characters in Words Separated by Commas

**Problem Description**: You are given a string with words separated by commas, and you need to sort the characters in each word while keeping the order of words and commas.

**Solution**: Split the string by commas, sort each word, and join them back together with commas.

```python
def sort_comma_separated(s):
    words = s.split(',')
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    return ','.join(sorted_words)

# Test
print(sort_comma_separated("apple,banana,cherry"))  # Output: "aelpp,abnno,ccehrry"
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution**:

1. **Split the Input String**: Use `split()` to break the input string into words.
2. **Sort Each Word**: Iterate over each word, split it into characters, sort the characters, and join them back.
3. **Reconstruct the Sentence**: Join the sorted words with spaces to form the final result.

**Python3 Code**:

```python
def anti_shuffle(s):
    words = s.split()
    sorted_words = [''.join(sorted(word)) for word in words]
    return ' '.join(sorted_words)

# Test cases
print(anti_shuffle('Hi'))  # Output: 'Hi'
print(anti_shuffle('hello'))  # Output: 'ehllo'
print(anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!'))  # Output: 'Hello !!!Wdlor'
```

This solution ensures that each word in the input string is sorted in ascending ASCII order while preserving the original order of words and spaces.

Hello !!!Wdlor

### Algorithms

The core concept used to solve this problem involves iterating through a two-dimensional list (matrix-like structure where each row can have a different number of elements). The goal is to find all occurrences of a specific value (`x`) and return their coordinates sorted according to specified rules.

1. **Nested Loops**: We need to use nested loops to traverse each element in the two-dimensional list.
2. **Condition Checking**: Check if the current element matches the target value `x`.
3. **Coordinate Storage**: Store the coordinates of matching elements.
4. **Sorting**: First, sort the coordinates by rows in ascending order. If there are multiple occurrences in the same row, sort those by columns in descending order.

### Tutorial

#### Nested Loops
Nested loops are used when you need to iterate over items in a two-dimensional collection. In this case, we will iterate over each sublist and then over each item within those sublists.

```python
for row_index, row in enumerate(matrix):
    for col_index, element in enumerate(row):
        # Process element here
```

#### Condition Checking
We need to check if the current element matches the target value `x`.

```python
if element == x:
    # Do something
```

#### Coordinate Storage
Store the coordinates of matching elements in a list of tuples.

```python
coordinates = [(row_index, col_index)]
```

#### Sorting
First, sort the coordinates by rows in ascending order. If there are multiple occurrences in the same row, sort those by columns in descending order.

```python
coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Find All Indices of Target Value in Matrix
**Problem Description**: Given a 2D matrix and a target value, find all indices where the target value occurs.

**Solution**: Use nested loops to iterate through the matrix and store indices where the target value matches.

**Python Code**:
```python
def find_all_indices(matrix, target):
    indices = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == target:
                indices.append((i, j))
    return indices
```

#### Problem 2: Sort Coordinates by Row Ascending and Column Descending
**Problem Description**: Given a list of coordinates, sort them first by row in ascending order and then by column in descending order.

**Solution**: Use the `sort` function with a custom key.

**Python Code**:
```python
def sort_coordinates(coordinates):
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    return coordinates
```

#### Problem 3: Find and Sort Specific Elements in a 2D List
**Problem Description**: Given a 2D list and a target value, find all occurrences of the target value and sort their coordinates accordingly.

**Solution**: Combine the steps from above to find the elements and sort their coordinates.

**Python Code**:
```python
def find_and_sort_elements(matrix, target):
    indices = []
    for i, row in enumerate(matrix):
        for j, val in enumerate(row):
            if val == target:
                indices.append((i, j))
    indices.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    return indices
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution**:
1. Traverse the 2D list using nested loops.
2. Collect the coordinates where the element matches the target value `x`.
3. Sort the collected coordinates by rows in ascending order and columns in descending order.
4. Return the sorted list of coordinates.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def get_row(lst, x):
    coordinates = []
    for row_idx, row in enumerate(lst):
        for col_idx, element in enumerate(row):
            if element == x:
                coordinates.append((row_idx, col_idx))
    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))
    return coordinates
```

### Core Concepts

The problem requires us to sort an array based on the parity of the sum of its first and last elements. The key concepts here are:

1. **Array Indexing**: Accessing the first (`array[0]`) and last (`array[-1]`) elements of the array.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculating the sum of the first and last elements.
3. **Conditional Sorting**: Determining whether to sort the array in ascending or descending order based on whether their sum is odd or even, respectively.
4. **Sorting Algorithms**: Using either Python's built-in `sorted()` function for ascending order or slicing with reverse indexing for descending order.

### Algorithm Explanation

1. **Check Array Length**:
   - If the array is empty or contains only one element, simply return a copy of the array as there's nothing to sort.

2. **Calculate Sum**:
   - Compute the sum of the first and last elements of the array.

3. **Determine Sort Order**:
   - If the sum is odd, sort the array in ascending order using `sorted()`.
   - If the sum is even, sort the array in descending order by slicing and reversing the sorted array.

### Tutorial

#### Arrays
An array is a collection of items stored at contiguous memory locations. In Python, arrays can be accessed by their indices, where the first element has index `0` and the last element has index `-1`.

#### Slicing
Slicing allows you to extract a portion of the array. For example, `array[start:end]` returns a new array containing elements from index `start` up to but not including index `end`. To reverse an array, use slicing with a step of `-1`, e.g., `array[::-1]`.

#### Conditional Statements
Conditional statements allow you to execute different blocks of code based on certain conditions. In Python, this is done using `if`, `elif`, and `else`.

### Example Problems

1. **Sort Array Based on First and Last Element**
   - **Problem**: Implement a function that sorts an array based on the sum of its first and last elements.
   - **Solution**: Similar to the original problem but without the constraint of not changing the original array.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def sort_array(arr):
         if len(arr) <= 1:
             return arr[:]
         sum_first_last = arr[0] + arr[-1]
         if sum_first_last % 2 == 0:
             return sorted(arr)
         else:
             return sorted(arr, reverse=True)
     ```

2. **Median of Sorted Array**
   - **Problem**: Find the median of two sorted arrays.
   - **Solution**: Merge the arrays and find the middle element(s).
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def find_median_sorted_arrays(nums1, nums2):
         merged = sorted(nums1 + nums2)
         n = len(merged)
         mid = n // 2
         if n % 2 == 0:
             return (merged[mid - 1] + merged[mid]) / 2
         else:
             return merged[mid]
     ```

3. **Remove Duplicates from Sorted List**
   - **Problem**: Remove duplicates from a sorted list in-place.
   - **Solution**: Use two pointers to track unique elements.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def remove_duplicates(nums):
         if not nums:
             return 0
         i = 0
         for j in range(1, len(nums)):
             if nums[j] != nums[i]:
                 i += 1
                 nums[i] = nums[j]
         return i + 1
     ```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Solution Explanation

1. **Base Case**: Check if the array is empty or contains only one element. Return a copy if true.
2. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the first and last elements.
3. **Sort Based on Parity**: Use `sorted()` for ascending and slicing with reverse indexing for descending.

```python
def sort_array(array):
    # Base case: if array is empty or has only one element, return a copy
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return array[:]
    
    # Calculate the sum of the first and last elements
    first_element = array[0]
    last_element = array[-1]
    total_sum = first_element + last_element
    
    # Sort based on the sum being odd or even
    if total_sum % 2 == 0:
        return sorted(array)
    else:
        return sorted(array, reverse=True)
```

This code checks the length of the array, calculates the sum of the first and last elements, and then sorts the array accordingly. The base case ensures that no changes are made to the array when necessary.

### Algorithms:
The core concept for this problem involves rotating characters in a string based on a specific mathematical operation. Specifically, we need to rotate each character in the input string by shifting it down by \(2 \times 2 = 4\) positions in the alphabet. This requires understanding how to handle character indices and wrapping around when reaching the end of the alphabet.

### Tutorial:
#### Rotating Characters in a String:
1. **Character Indexing**: Each character in a string can be accessed using its index. In Python, indexing starts at 0.
2. **Alphabet Wrap-Around**: When shifting characters, if you reach the end of the alphabet ('z'), you need to wrap around to the beginning ('a').
3. **ASCII Values**: To perform the rotation, we can use ASCII values. Each letter from 'a' to 'z' has a corresponding ASCII value. By adding the desired number of shifts to the ASCII value of a character and taking modulo 26 (since there are 26 letters in the alphabet), we can ensure the new character wraps correctly.

### Example Problems:
1. **Problem**: [UVA - 10755 - Caesar Cipher]
   - **Description**: Encrypt a given message by shifting each letter by a fixed number of positions.
   - **Solution**: Use a loop to iterate through each character and apply the shift. Handle wrap-around using modulo arithmetic.
   
2. **Problem**: [LeetCode - 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero]
   - **Description**: Given a non-negative integer num, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, if the current number is even, divide it by 2; otherwise, subtract 1.
   - **Solution**: Simulate the process using simple arithmetic operations and a counter.
   
3. **Problem**: [HackerRank - Counting Valleys]
   - **Description**: Determine the number of valleys walked through in a sequence of steps represented by 'U' (up) and 'D' (down).
   - **Solution**: Track elevation changes and count whenever you go below sea level.

1. Iterate through each character in the input string.
2. Convert the character to its ASCII value.
3. Shift the ASCII value by 4 positions.
4. Ensure the new character wraps around using modulo 26.
5. Convert the shifted ASCII value back to a character.
6. Append the new character to the result string.

```python
def encrypt(s):
    encrypted_string = []
    
    for char in s:
        # Check if the character is a lowercase letter
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            # Calculate the new ASCII value after shifting by 4 positions
            new_ascii = ord(char) + 4
            # Wrap around if necessary
            if new_ascii > ord('z'):
                new_ascii -= 26
            # Convert the new ASCII value back to a character
            encrypted_char = chr(new_ascii)
        else:
            # If not a lowercase letter, leave it unchanged
            encrypted_char = char
        
        encrypted_string.append(encrypted_char)
    
    return ''.join(encrypted_string)

# Test cases
print(encrypt('hi'))       # Output: 'lm'
print(encrypt('asdfghjkl')) # Output: 'ewhjklnop'
print(encrypt('gf'))       # Output: 'kj'
print(encrypt('et'))       # Output: 'ix'
```

This code handles the encryption by rotating characters within the bounds of the English alphabet while leaving non-alphabetic characters unchanged.

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

To solve the problem of finding the second smallest element in a list of integers, we need to identify the smallest and the second smallest unique elements. The key concepts involved are:

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the list can help us easily access the smallest and second smallest elements.
2. **Unique Elements**: Since we are looking for the second smallest unique element, we need to ensure that duplicates are handled correctly.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handling empty lists and lists with all identical elements ensures our solution robustness.

### Tutorial on Sorting and Unique Elements

**Sorting**: 
- Sorting an array rearranges its elements from smallest to largest.
- In Python, this can be achieved using `sorted()` function or `sort()` method for lists.

**Unique Elements**:
- To handle duplicates, we can convert the list to a set (which automatically removes duplicates) and then back to a sorted list.
- This ensures that each element appears only once.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Find the Second Largest Element
Given an array of integers, find the second largest element.

**Solution**:
1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Return the second element.

```python
def second_largest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst, reverse=True)
    return sorted_lst[1]
```

#### Problem 2: Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array
Given a sorted array, remove all duplicates so that each element appears only once and return the new length.

**Solution**:
1. Use two pointers to iterate through the array.
2. Move the slow pointer only when a new unique element is found.

```python
def remove_duplicates(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

#### Problem 3: Kth Smallest Element in an Array
Find the kth smallest element in an unsorted array.

**Solution**:
1. Sort the array.
2. Return the kth element.

```python
import heapq

def kth_smallest(nums, k):
    return heapq.nsmallest(k, nums)[-1]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
1. Convert the list to a set to remove duplicates.
2. If the resulting set has less than 2 elements, return `None`.
3. Otherwise, sort the set and return the second smallest element.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def next_smallest(lst):
    # Convert list to set to remove duplicates
    unique_elements = set(lst)
    
    # Check if there are at least 2 unique elements
    if len(unique_elements) < 2:
        return None
    
    # Sort the unique elements and get the second smallest
    sorted_elements = sorted(unique_elements)
    return sorted_elements[1]

# Test cases
print(next_smallest([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 2
print(next_smallest([5, 1, 4, 3, 2]))  # Output: 2
print(next_smallest([]))               # Output: None
print(next_smallest([1, 1]))           # Output: None
```

This solution handles all edge cases, including empty lists and lists with all identical elements, ensuring robustness.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
To solve this problem, we need to identify sentences in the input string that start with the word "I" and count them as "boredoms". Here are the steps involved in solving this problem using Python:

1. **Splitting the String**: We need to split the input string into individual sentences.
2. **Checking Sentences**: Each sentence needs to be checked if it starts with the word "I" (case-insensitive).
3. **Counting Boredoms**: If a sentence meets the condition, increment the boredom counter.

## Tutorial:
### Splitting the String
In Python, we can use the `split()` method to divide a string into parts based on a delimiter. For this problem, we will use a regular expression to handle multiple delimiters (`.` `?` `!`). The `re.split()` function from the `re` module allows us to split the string at one or more occurrences of the delimiters.

```python
import re

text = "Hello world. The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather!"
sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', text)
print(sentences)  # Output: ['Hello world', 'The sky is blue', 'The sun is shining', 'I love this weather']
```

### Checking Sentences
To check if a sentence starts with the word "I", we can use the `startswith()` method. Since we need to consider both uppercase and lowercase versions of "I", we convert the sentence to lowercase before checking.

```python
sentence = "I love this weather"
if sentence.lower().startswith('i'):
    print(True)  # Output: True
else:
    print(False)
```

### Counting Boredoms
We initialize a counter to zero and iterate through the list of sentences, incrementing the counter for each sentence that starts with "I".

## Example Problems:
Here are three example problems related to string manipulation and regular expressions that involve similar algorithms:

1. **Problem**: Check if a given string contains a specific substring.
   - **Solution**: Use the `in` keyword to check for substring presence.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def contains_substring(string, substring):
         return substring in string
     ```

2. **Problem**: Extract all email addresses from a given text.
   - **Solution**: Use regular expressions to match patterns.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     import re

     def extract_emails(text):
         email_pattern = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
         emails = re.findall(email_pattern, text)
         return emails
     ```

3. **Problem**: Replace all occurrences of a word in a string.
   - **Solution**: Use the `replace()` method or regular expressions.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def replace_word(string, old_word, new_word):
         return string.replace(old_word, new_word)
     ```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
1. **Split the Input String**: Use `re.split()` to divide the input string into sentences.
2. **Initialize Counter**: Set a counter to zero to keep track of boredoms.
3. **Iterate Through Sentences**: Loop through each sentence and check if it starts with "I" (case-insensitive).
4. **Increment Counter**: If a sentence starts with "I", increment the counter.
5. **Return Result**: Return the total number of boredoms.

### Python3 Code:
```python
import re

def is_bored(S):
    sentences = re.split(r'[.?!]\s*', S)
    boredom_count = sum(sentence.lower().startswith('i') for sentence in sentences)
    return boredom_count

# Test cases
print(is_bored("Hello world"))  # Output: 0
print(is_bored("The sky is blue. The sun is shining. I love this weather"))  # Output: 1
```

This code correctly identifies and counts the number of sentences starting with "I", thus determining the number of "boredoms" in the input string.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The problem requires us to perform two main operations on the input string: swapping the case of all letters and replacing vowels with the letter that appears two places ahead in the English alphabet. 

### Swapping Case:
Swapping the case of a character can be achieved using Python's built-in `swapcase()` method for strings. This method converts all lowercase characters to uppercase and vice versa.

### Replacing Vowels:
To replace vowels, we need to map each vowel to its corresponding character that is two places ahead in the alphabet. We can use a dictionary to store this mapping and then iterate over the string to replace each vowel accordingly. Note that both uppercase and lowercase vowels should be considered.

## Tutorial:
### Swapping Case:
In Python, you can swap the case of a string using the `swapcase()` method. This method returns a new string with all the lowercase characters converted to uppercase and vice versa.

```python
text = "Hello World"
swapped_text = text.swapcase()
print(swapped_text)  # Output: hELLO wORLD
```

### Replacing Vowels:
To replace vowels, you can create a dictionary that maps each vowel to its corresponding replacement. Iterate through the string and replace each vowel using the dictionary. Here's an example:

```python
vowel_replacements = {'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
                      'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'}

def replace_vowels(text, replacements):
    result = []
    for char in text:
        if char in replacements:
            result.append(replacements[char])
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

text = "hello world"
replaced_text = replace_vowels(text, vowel_replacements)
print(replaced_text)  # Output: hckkk wrld
```

## Example Problems:
### Problem 1: Swap Case and Replace Vowels
**Problem Statement:** Given a string, swap the case of all letters and replace all vowels with the letter that appears 2 places ahead in the English alphabet.

**Solution:** Use the `swapcase()` method to swap cases and create a dictionary for vowel replacements.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def encode_problem1(s):
    # Define the vowel replacements
    vowel_replacements = {'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
                          'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'}
    
    # Swap cases
    swapped_s = s.swapcase()
    
    # Replace vowels
    encoded_s = ''.join([vowel_replacements.get(c, c) for c in swapped_s])
    
    return encoded_s

print(encode_problem1("test"))  # Output: tGST
print(encode_problem1("This is a message"))  # Output: tHKS KS C MGSSCGG
```

### Problem 2: Advanced String Manipulation
**Problem Statement:** Given a string, reverse the order of words and then swap the case of each character within those words.

**Solution:** Split the string into words, reverse the list of words, and apply the `swapcase()` method to each word.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def advanced_string_manipulation(s):
    words = s.split()
    reversed_words = words[::-1]
    result = ' '.join(word.swapcase() for word in reversed_words)
    return result

print(advanced_string_manipulation("hello world"))  # Output: DLROw OLLEh
```

### Problem 3: Encoding Messages
**Problem Statement:** Given a message, encode it by swapping the case of all letters and replacing all vowels with the next character in the English alphabet.

**Solution:** Similar to the original problem, but replace vowels with the next character instead of two places ahead.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def encoding_messages(s):
    vowel_replacements = {'a': 'b', 'e': 'f', 'i': 'j', 'o': 'p', 'u': 'v',
                          'A': 'B', 'E': 'F', 'I': 'J', 'O': 'P', 'U': 'V'}
    
    swapped_s = s.swapcase()
    encoded_s = ''.join([vowel_replacements.get(c, c) for c in swapped_s])
    
    return encoded_s

print(encoding_messages("test"))  # Output: TGST
print(encoding_messages("This is a message"))  # Output: tHKS KS B mGSSBGFF
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
1. Create a dictionary to map each vowel to its corresponding character that is two places ahead in the English alphabet.
2. Use the `swapcase()` method to swap the case of all characters in the input string.
3. Iterate through the swapped string and replace each vowel using the dictionary.
4. Join the modified characters back into a single string and return it.

### Python3 Code:
```python
def encode(message):
    vowel_replacements = {'a': 'c', 'e': 'g', 'i': 'k', 'o': 'q', 'u': 'w',
                          'A': 'C', 'E': 'G', 'I': 'K', 'O': 'Q', 'U': 'W'}
    
    swapped_message = message.swapcase()
    encoded_message = ''.join(vowel_replacements.get(c, c) for c in swapped_message)
    
    return encoded_message

# Test cases
print(encode('test'))  # Output: TGST
print(encode('This is a message'))  # Output: tHKS KS C MGSSCGG
```
This code correctly encodes the input message according to the specified rules.

### Core Concepts & Algorithms

The problem requires identifying the largest prime number within a given list of integers and then calculating the sum of its digits. Here are the key steps involved:

1. **Prime Number Check**: Determine if a number is prime.
2. **Finding the Largest Prime**: Iterate through the list to identify the largest prime number.
3. **Summing Digits**: Once the largest prime number is found, calculate the sum of its digits.

To implement this, we'll use basic algorithms for checking primality and iterating through lists.

### Tutorial on Algorithms

#### 1. Prime Number Check
A number is prime if it has no divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if a number `n` is prime:
- If `n <= 1`, it's not prime.
- If `n == 2`, it's prime.
- For numbers greater than 2, check divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`.

#### 2. Finding the Largest Prime
Iterate through the list of integers and keep track of the largest prime number encountered.

#### 3. Summing Digits
Convert the prime number to a string and sum the integer values of its characters.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Find the largest prime number in a list
**Problem Description**: Given a list of integers, find the largest prime number.
**Solution**: Use the prime number check function to filter out non-prime numbers and keep track of the maximum prime number.

```python
def largest_prime(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    max_prime = None
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num):
            if max_prime is None or num > max_prime:
                max_prime = num
    return max_prime

# Example usage
print(largest_prime([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output: 181
```

#### Problem 2: Sum of digits of the largest prime
**Problem Description**: Given a list of integers, find the largest prime and return the sum of its digits.
**Solution**: Extend the previous solution to include summing the digits of the largest prime.

```python
def sum_of_digits_of_largest_prime(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    max_prime = None
    for num in lst:
        if is_prime(num):
            if max_prime is None or num > max_prime:
                max_prime = num
    
    if max_prime is None:
        return 0
    
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(max_prime))

# Example usage
print(sum_of_digits_of_largest_prime([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output: 10
```

#### Problem 3: Maximum Sum of Consecutive Primes
**Problem Description**: Given a list of integers, find the subarray with the maximum sum where all elements are prime numbers.
**Solution**: Use dynamic programming to find the longest subarray of consecutive primes and then compute their sum.

```python
def max_sum_consecutive_primes(lst):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n <= 1:
            return False
        if n == 2:
            return True
        for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    start = 0
    for end, num in enumerate(lst):
        if is_prime(num):
            current_sum += num
        else:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
            while start < end and not is_prime(lst[start]):
                start += 1
            start += 1
            current_sum = sum(lst[start:end+1])
    
    return max(max_sum, current_sum)

# Example usage
print(max_sum_consecutive_primes([0,3,2,1,3,5,7,4,5,5,5,2,181,32,4,32,3,2,32,324,4,3]))  # Output: 255
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation
1. Define a helper function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime.
2. Initialize variables to keep track of the largest prime number and its sum of digits.
3. Iterate through the list, updating the largest prime number when a larger one is found.
4. After finding the largest prime, convert it to a string and sum its digits.

### Core Concepts / Algorithms

The key concept here is checking the case consistency of keys in a dictionary. Specifically, we need to ensure that either all keys are lowercase or all keys are uppercase. If the dictionary is empty, the function should return `False`. We will iterate through the keys and use string methods to determine their cases.

### Tutorial on Checking Case Consistency of Strings

To check if a string is entirely in lowercase or uppercase, you can use Python's built-in string methods:

- `.islower()`: Returns `True` if all cased characters in the string are lowercase and there is at least one cased character, otherwise returns `False`.
- `.isupper()`: Returns `True` if all cased characters in the string are uppercase and there is at least one cased character, otherwise returns `False`.

These methods help us easily determine the case of each key in the dictionary.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Check if All Characters in a String are Lowercase

**Problem**: Given a string, write a function to check if all characters in the string are lowercase.

**Solution**:
```python
def is_all_lowercase(s):
    return s.islower()

# Example usage:
print(is_all_lowercase("hello"))  # Output: True
print(is_all_lowercase("Hello"))  # Output: False
```

**Explanation**: The function uses the `islower()` method to check if the input string `s` contains only lowercase letters.

#### Problem 2: Check if All Characters in a String are Uppercase

**Problem**: Given a string, write a function to check if all characters in the string are uppercase.

**Solution**:
```python
def is_all_uppercase(s):
    return s.isupper()

# Example usage:
print(is_all_uppercase("HELLO"))  # Output: True
print(is_all_uppercase("Hello"))  # Output: False
```

**Explanation**: The function uses the `isupper()` method to check if the input string `s` contains only uppercase letters.

#### Problem 3: Determine if Keys in a Dictionary are All Lowercase or Uppercase

**Problem**: Given a dictionary, write a function to check if all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase. Return `False` if the dictionary is empty.

**Solution**:
```python
def check_dict_case(d):
    if not d:
        return False
    
    has_lower = any(key.islower() for key in d.keys())
    has_upper = any(key.isupper() for key in d.keys())
    
    return has_lower == has_upper

# Example usage:
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"}))  # Output: True
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "banana", "B": "banana"}))  # Output: False
print(check_dict_case({}))  # Output: False
```

**Explanation**: The function first checks if the dictionary is empty. If not, it uses list comprehensions with `any()` to determine if there are any lowercase or uppercase keys. Finally, it checks if exactly one of `has_lower` or `has_upper` is `True`, indicating that all keys are either all lowercase or all uppercase.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
- We start by checking if the dictionary is empty. If it is, we return `False`.
- We then create two boolean variables, `all_lower` and `all_upper`, to track whether all keys are lowercase or uppercase.
- We iterate through the keys using a generator expression within `any()`. This efficiently finds the first key that meets the condition.
- Finally, we return `True` if exactly one of `all_lower` or `all_upper` is `True`; otherwise, we return `False`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def check_dict_case(d):
    if not d:
        return False
    
    all_lower = all(key.islower() for key in d.keys())
    all_upper = all(key.isupper() for key in d.keys())
    
    return all_lower != all_upper

# Example usage:
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "b": "banana"}))  # Output: True
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", "A": "banana", "B": "banana"}))  # Output: False
print(check_dict_case({"a": "apple", 8: "banana", "a": "apple"}))  # Output: False
print(check_dict_case({"Name": "John", "Age": "36", "City": "Houston"}))  # Output: False
print(check_dict_case({"STATE": "NC", "ZIP": "12345"}))  # Output: True
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above and solves the given problem effectively.

### Core Concepts

#### Prime Number Identification
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To determine if a number is prime, we can check if it is divisible by any number from 2 up to its square root.

#### Sieve of Eratosthenes
The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used to find all prime numbers up to a given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime number starting from 2. The numbers which remain unmarked at the end of this process are the primes.

### Tutorial

#### Implementing a Function to Check if a Number is Prime
To check if a number `n` is prime, you can use the following steps:
1. If `n` is less than 2, return `False`.
2. Iterate from 2 to the square root of `n`. If `n` is divisible by any of these numbers, return `False`.
3. If no divisors are found, return `True`.

```python
import math

def is_prime(num):
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(num)) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

#### Using the Sieve of Eratosthenes
To generate all prime numbers up to a given limit `n`, you can implement the Sieve of Eratosthenes as follows:
1. Create a boolean array `is_prime[0..n]` and initialize all entries as `True`. An entry in `is_prime[i]` will finally be `False` if `i` is Not a prime, else `True`.
2. Mark `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` as `False` because they are not prime numbers.
3. Iterate from 2 to the square root of `n`. For every number `p`, if `is_prime[p]` is still `True`, mark all multiples of `p` as `False`.

```python
def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    primes = [True for _ in range(limit+1)]
    p = 2
    while (p * p <= limit):
        if (primes[p] == True):
            for i in range(p * p, limit+1, p):
                primes[i] = False
        p += 1
    return [p for p in range(2, limit) if primes[p]]
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Counting Primes Up to N
**Problem**: Given a non-negative integer `n`, count the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

**Solution**: Use the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function to generate all prime numbers up to `n` and return their count.

```python
def count_primes(n):
    return len(sieve_of_eratosthenes(n))
```

#### Problem 2: Prime Factors of a Number
**Problem**: Given a non-negative integer `n`, return its prime factors.

**Solution**: Use the `is_prime` function to check for divisibility and collect the prime factors.

```python
def prime_factors(n):
    factors = []
    # Check for number of 2s that divide n
    while n % 2 == 0:
        factors.append(2)
        n = n // 2
    # n must be odd at this point, so a skip of 2 (i = i + 2) can be used
    for i in range(3, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1, 2):
        # While i divides n, append i and divide n
        while n % i == 0:
            factors.append(i)
            n = n // i
    # Condition if n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        factors.append(n)
    return factors
```

#### Problem 3: Sum of Primes
**Problem**: Given a non-negative integer `n`, find the sum of all prime numbers less than `n`.

**Solution**: Use the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function to generate all prime numbers up to `n` and sum them up.

```python
def sum_of_primes(n):
    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(n)
    return sum(primes)
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
To solve the original problem, we need to generate all prime numbers less than `n`. We can use the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function to achieve this efficiently.

#### Python3 Code
```python
import math

def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
    primes = [True for _ in range(limit+1)]
    p = 2
    while (p * p <= limit):
        if (primes[p] == True):
            for i in range(p * p, limit+1, p):
                primes[i] = False
        p += 1
    return [p for p in range(2, limit) if primes[p]]

def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes an non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n."""
    return sieve_of_eratosthenes(n)

# Test cases
print(count_up_to(5))   # Output: [2, 3]
print(count_up_to(11))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7]
print(count_up_to(0))   # Output: []
print(count_up_to(20))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19]
print(count_up_to(1))   # Output: []
print(count_up_to(18))  # Output: [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
```

This code defines the `count_up_to` function that uses the `sieve_of_eratosthenes` function to generate all prime numbers less than `n` and returns them as a list. The provided test cases demonstrate the correctness of the implementation.

- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
### Problem Explanation

The problem requires us to create a function `multiply` that takes two integers as input and returns the product of their unit digits. The unit digit of an integer is the rightmost digit of the number.

For example:
- The unit digit of 148 is 8.
- The unit digit of 412 is 2.
- Therefore, `multiply(148, 412)` should return \(8 \times 2 = 16\).

Similarly, for other inputs:
- `multiply(19, 28)` should return \(9 \times 8 = 72\).
- `multiply(2020, 1851)` should return \(0 \times 1 = 0\) because both numbers have a unit digit of 0.
- `multiply(14, -15)` should return \(4 \times 5 = 20\) because we consider the absolute values of the unit digits.

### Core Concepts/Algorithms

1. **Extracting the Unit Digit**: To get the unit digit of a number, we can use the modulus operator `%` with 10. This operation gives the remainder when the number is divided by 10, which is the rightmost digit.
   
2. **Multiplication**: Once we have the unit digits, we simply multiply them together to get the result.

### Tutorial on Extracting the Unit Digit and Multiplication

#### Extracting the Unit Digit

To extract the unit digit of a number, you can use the modulo operation with 10. For example:

```python
x = 148
unit_digit_x = x % 10  # unit_digit_x will be 8
```

#### Multiplication

Once you have extracted the unit digits, you can simply multiply them together:

```python
y = 412
unit_digit_y = y % 10  # unit_digit_y will be 2
product = unit_digit_x * unit_digit_y  # product will be 16
```

### Example Problems

Here are three example problems that involve similar concepts:

1. **Problem**: [Unit Digit Product]
   - **Description**: Write a function that takes two integers and returns the product of their unit digits.
   - **Solution**: Similar to the original problem, extract the unit digits using `% 10` and multiply them.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def unit_digit_product(a, b):
         return (a % 10) * (b % 10)
     ```

2. **Problem**: [Last Digit Sum]
   - **Description**: Write a function that takes two integers and returns the sum of their last digits.
   - **Solution**: Extract the last digits using `% 10` and add them together.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def last_digit_sum(a, b):
         return (a % 10) + (b % 10)
     ```

3. **Problem**: [Digit Product Array]
   - **Description**: Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns an array where each element is the product of the unit digits of the corresponding elements in the input array.
   - **Solution**: Iterate through the array, extract the unit digits using `% 10`, and multiply them together.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def digit_product_array(arr):
         return [(num % 10) * ((num // 10) % 10) for num in arr]
     ```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Extract Unit Digits**: Use the modulus operator `% 10` to get the unit digit of both input numbers.
2. **Multiply the Unit Digits**: Multiply the extracted unit digits together to get the result.

#### Python3 Code to Solve the Problem

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    """Complete the function that takes two integers and returns 
    the product of their unit digits.
    Assume the input is always valid.
    Examples:

    multiply(19, 28) should return 72.
    multiply(2020, 1851) should return 0.
    multiply(14,-15) should return 20.
    """
    # Extract the unit digits
    unit_digit_a = abs(a) % 10
    unit_digit_b = abs(b) % 10
    
    # Return the product of the unit digits
    return unit_digit_a * unit_digit_b
```

This code correctly handles the extraction of unit digits and their multiplication, ensuring the solution meets the requirements of the problem.

### Core Concepts & Algorithms

The task involves counting the number of uppercase vowels at even indices in a given string. The core concepts here are:
1. **String Indexing**: Accessing characters in a string by their position (index).
2. **Character Comparison**: Determining if a character falls within a specific range (e.g., uppercase vowels).
3. **Looping**: Iterating through the string to check each character.

To solve this problem, we can use a simple loop to iterate through the string, checking every character at an even index to see if it is an uppercase vowel.

### Tutorial

**String Indexing**
- In Python, strings are zero-indexed, meaning the first character is at index `0`, the second at `1`, and so on.
- To access a character at a specific index, you can use square brackets `[]` with the index as the value inside them. For example, `s[0]` will return the first character of the string `s`.

**Character Comparison**
- We need to determine if a character is an uppercase vowel. Uppercase vowels are 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', and 'U'.
- We can use the `in` keyword to check if a character is in a predefined set of uppercase vowels.

**Looping**
- A for loop can be used to iterate over the indices of the string using the `range()` function combined with `len()` to get the length of the string.
- Inside the loop, we can check if the current index is even by using `i % 2 == 0`.

### Example Problems

#### Example 1: Count Lowercase Vowels at Odd Indices
**Problem**: Given a string `s`, count the number of lowercase vowels at odd indices.
**Solution**: Iterate through the string, checking every character at an odd index to see if it is a lowercase vowel.
```python
def count_lower(s):
    vowels = 'aeiou'
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, len(s), 2):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            count += 1
    return count
```

#### Example 2: Reverse String While Maintaining Case
**Problem**: Given a string `s`, reverse the string while maintaining the case of each character.
**Solution**: Use slicing to reverse the string and maintain the case by directly accessing each character's case.
```python
def reverse_string(s):
    reversed_str = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            reversed_str = char.lower() + reversed_str
        else:
            reversed_str = char.upper() + reversed_str
    return reversed_str
```

#### Example 3: Check if String Contains All Unique Characters
**Problem**: Given a string `s`, check if all characters in the string are unique.
**Solution**: Use a set to track seen characters and ensure no duplicates.
```python
def has_unique_chars(s):
    seen_chars = set()
    for char in s:
        if char in seen_chars:
            return False
        seen_chars.add(char)
    return True
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**: The solution uses a loop to iterate through the string, checking each character at an even index to see if it is an uppercase vowel. If it is, we increment our count.

```python
def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    """
    count = 0
    for i in range(0, len(s), 2):
        if s[i] in 'AEIOU':
            count += 1
    return count
```

This code iterates through the string, checking every character at an even index (`0, 2, 4, ...`). It checks if the character is an uppercase vowel by seeing if it is in the string `'AEIOU'`. If it is, the count is incremented. Finally, the total count is returned.

### Core Concepts

The problem requires rounding a numeric string to the nearest integer, with specific rules for when the number is exactly halfway between two integers. The rule here is to round away from zero, which means that for numbers like "14.5" or "-14.5", we need to choose the integer further from zero. This differs from standard rounding where such cases would typically be rounded to the nearest even number (bankers' rounding).

### Algorithms

1. **Convert String to Float**: First, convert the input string to a floating-point number. This allows us to perform arithmetic operations on the number.
2. **Check Midpoint Condition**: Determine if the fractional part of the number is exactly 0.5. If so, apply the rounding away from zero rule.
3. **Round Away from Zero**: If the number is equidistant from two integers (i.e., the fractional part is 0.5), decide whether to round up or down based on the sign of the number.

### Tutorial

#### Convert String to Float
Converting a string to a float ensures that we can perform mathematical operations accurately.

```python
value = "15.3"
number = float(value)
```

#### Check Midpoint Condition
We can check if the fractional part is 0.5 using modulo operation.

```python
fractional_part = abs(number % 1)
if fractional_part == 0.5:
    # Apply rounding away from zero logic
    pass
```

#### Round Away from Zero
For positive numbers, adding 0.5 and truncating gives the required result. For negative numbers, subtracting 0.5 and truncating also gives the desired result.

```python
rounded_number = int(number + 0.5) if number >= 0 else int(number - 0.5)
```

### Example Problems

**Problem 1: Closest Integer Rounding**

Given a string representing a number, return the closest integer to it, rounding away from zero if necessary.

**Solution**:
- Convert the string to a float.
- Check if the number is equidistant from two integers.
- Round the number accordingly.

**Python3 Code**:

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

The given problem involves generating a sequence based on the parity (odd/even nature) of an input integer \( n \). Specifically, for each level \( i \) starting from 0 up to \( n-1 \), we need to determine whether \( n \) is odd or even, and then generate the number of stones in that level accordingly. 

**Algorithms Used:**
1. **Condition Checking:** To check if a number is odd or even.
2. **Sequence Generation:** Using arithmetic operations to generate the next odd or even number based on the current value.

### Tutorial

#### Condition Checking

In Python, we can use the modulus operator `%` to check if a number is odd or even. If `n % 2 == 0`, the number is even; otherwise, it's odd.

```python
def is_even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

def is_odd(n):
    return not is_even(n)
```

#### Sequence Generation

If the number \( n \) is odd, the next odd number is obtained by adding 2 to \( n \). Similarly, if \( n \) is even, the next even number is also obtained by adding 2 to \( n \).

```python
def next_odd_or_even(n):
    if is_odd(n):
        return n + 2
    else:
        return n + 2
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Generate Odd Numbers

Given a positive integer \( n \), generate a list of the first \( n \) odd numbers.

**Solution:**

1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
2. Start with the first odd number (1).
3. For each iteration, add the next odd number to the list until \( n \) elements are generated.

```python
def generate_odds(n):
    result = []
    num = 1
    for _ in range(n):
        result.append(num)
        num += 2
    return result

print(generate_odds(4))  # Output: [1, 3, 5, 7]
```

#### Problem 2: Sum of Even Numbers

Given a positive integer \( n \), calculate the sum of the first \( n \) even numbers.

**Solution:**

1. Initialize a variable to store the sum.
2. Start with the first even number (2).
3. For each iteration, add the next even number to the sum until \( n \) even numbers are added.

```python
def sum_of_evens(n):
    total = 0
    num = 2
    for _ in range(n):
        total += num
        num += 2
    return total

print(sum_of_evens(3))  # Output: 12
```

#### Problem 3: Fibonacci Series

Generate the first \( n \) terms of the Fibonacci series.

**Solution:**

1. Initialize the first two terms of the series (0 and 1).
2. For each subsequent term, add the last two terms to get the next term.
3. Append each new term to the result list.

```python
def fibonacci_series(n):
    result = [0, 1]
    while len(result) < n:
        result.append(result[-1] + result[-2])
    return result[:n]

print(fibonacci_series(5))  # Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

To solve the original problem, we need to follow these steps:
1. Initialize a list to store the number of stones in each level.
2. Start with \( n \) stones for the first level.
3. For each subsequent level, determine the next odd or even number based on whether \( n \) is odd or even.
4. Append the number of stones for each level to the list.

```python
def make_a_pile(n):
    result = []
    current_stones = n
    for _ in range(n):
        result.append(current_stones)
        current_stones = next_odd_or_even(current_stones)
    return result

def next_odd_or_even(n):
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n + 2
    else:
        return n + 2

# Test the function
print(make_a_pile(3))  # Output: [3, 5, 7]
```

This code correctly generates the required pile of stones based on the given rules.

### Core Concepts

The problem involves parsing a string that contains words separated by either commas or spaces. The core concept here is **string splitting**. This can be achieved using the `split()` method available in Python strings. By specifying the delimiter as a comma followed by a space (`, `), we can handle both separators simultaneously.

### Algorithms

1. **String Splitting**: Use the `split()` method to break the string into substrings based on the specified delimiter.
2. **Handling Multiple Delimiters**: Since the string might contain both commas and spaces, we need to ensure that the delimiter accounts for both.

### Tutorial

#### String Splitting

The `split()` method in Python splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The default delimiter is any whitespace, but you can specify a different delimiter.

```python
s = "Hello world"
words = s.split()  # ['Hello', 'world']
```

If you want to split the string based on a specific character, such as a comma, you can do so by passing the character as an argument:

```python
s = "apple,banana,cherry"
fruits = s.split(',')  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

#### Handling Multiple Delimiters

To handle multiple delimiters, you can use regular expressions (regex) with the `re` module. The `re.split()` function allows you to split a string based on a pattern.

```python
import re

s = "one,two three,four"
items = re.split(r'[,\s]+', s)  # ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
```

In this example, `[,\s]+` is a regex pattern that matches one or more occurrences of either a comma or a whitespace.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Split String with Commas and Spaces

**Problem Statement**: Given a string with words separated by commas or spaces, split the string into words.

**Solution**: Use the `re.split()` function with the regex pattern `[,\s]+`.

```python
def split_string(s):
    import re
    return re.split(r'[,\s]+', s)

# Test cases
print(split_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
print(split_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
```

#### Problem 2: Remove Punctuation from Words

**Problem Statement**: Given a string with words containing punctuation, remove all punctuation and split the string into words.

**Solution**: Use the `re.split()` function along with `re.sub()` to remove punctuation.

```python
import re

def split_and_clean(s):
    cleaned = re.sub(r'[^\w\s]', '', s)  # Remove punctuation
    return re.split(r'\s+', cleaned)

# Test cases
print(split_and_clean("Hello, World!"))  # ['Hello', 'World']
print(split_and_clean("This is a test."))  # ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test']
```

#### Problem 3: Split CSV Line

**Problem Statement**: Given a line from a CSV file, split the line into values, handling commas and spaces.

**Solution**: Use the `csv` module which provides a robust way to parse CSV data.

```python
import csv
from io import StringIO

def parse_csv_line(line):
    reader = csv.reader(StringIO(line))
    return next(reader)

# Test cases
print(parse_csv_line("one,two three,four"))  # ['one', 'two', 'three', 'four']
print(parse_csv_line("apple,banana,cherry"))  # ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution**: The solution uses the `re.split()` function with the regex pattern `[,\s]+` to split the input string into words, effectively handling both commas and spaces as separators.

**Python3 Code**:

```python
def words_string(s):
    import re
    return re.split(r'[,\s]+', s)

# Test cases
print(words_string("Hi, my name is John"))  # ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
print(words_string("One, two, three, four, five, six"))  # ['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']
```

This code correctly splits the input string into words, handling both commas and spaces as separators.
['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'John']
['One', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six']

### Core Concepts

The problem requires finding the largest even number within a given range \([x, y]\). Here are the key concepts involved:

1. **Range**: The problem specifies a range defined by two integers \(x\) and \(y\). We need to consider all integers from \(x\) to \(y\), inclusive.
  
2. **Even Numbers**: An even number is an integer that can be divided by 2 without leaving a remainder. We need to identify which numbers in the range are even.

3. **Largest Even Number**: From the set of even numbers in the range, we need to find the maximum value.

### Tutorial

#### Identifying the Largest Even Number in a Range

To find the largest even number in a range, we can iterate through the range in reverse order (from \(y\) to \(x\)) and check for even numbers. This ensures that the first even number encountered will be the largest one.

Here¡¯s how you can implement this logic:

1. Start with the number \(y\).
2. Check if \(y\) is even.
   - If yes, return \(y\).
   - If no, decrement \(y\) by 1 and repeat the check until you either find an even number or reach \(x\).
3. If no even number is found after checking up to \(x\), return \(-1\).

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Find the Maximum Even Number Less Than or Equal to a Given Number

**Problem Statement**: Given a single integer \(n\), find the maximum even number less than or equal to \(n\).

**Solution**: Iterate backwards from \(n\) to 1 and return the first even number encountered.

```python
def max_even(n):
    for num in range(n, 0, -1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num
    return -1
```

#### Problem 2: Find the Smallest Odd Number Greater Than or Equal to a Given Number

**Problem Statement**: Given a single integer \(n\), find the smallest odd number greater than or equal to \(n\).

**Solution**: Iterate forwards from \(n\) to infinity and return the first odd number encountered.

```python
def min_odd(n):
    while n % 2 != 0:
        n += 1
    return n
```

#### Problem 3: Count the Number of Even Numbers in a Given Range

**Problem Statement**: Given two integers \(a\) and \(b\) (where \(a \leq b\)), count the number of even numbers in the range \([a, b]\).

**Solution**: Calculate the difference between the largest even number less than or equal to \(b\) and the smallest even number greater than or equal to \(a\), and add 1.

```python
def count_evens(a, b):
    start = (a + 1) // 2 * 2  # First even number >= a
    end = b - (b % 2)         # Last even number <= b
    return (end - start) // 2 + 1
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution

1. **Edge Case Handling**: If \(x > y\), return \(-1\) because the range is invalid.
2. **Iterate Backwards**: Start from \(y\) and move downwards until we find an even number or reach \(x\).
3. **Return the Result**: If an even number is found, return it; otherwise, return \(-1\).

#### Python3 Code

```python
def choose_num(x, y):
    if x > y:
        return -1
    for num in range(y, x - 1, -1):
        if num % 2 == 0:
            return num
    return -1
```

This code efficiently finds the largest even number in the specified range by iterating backward and checking for evenness.

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

**Core Concept:** The problem involves calculating the average of a range of integers, rounding this average to the nearest integer, and converting the result to its binary representation. 

**Algorithms Used:**
1. **Range Calculation:** Generating all integers from `n` to `m`.
2. **Average Calculation:** Summing up all the integers in the range and dividing by the number of integers.
3. **Rounding:** Rounding the calculated average to the nearest integer using Python's built-in `round()` function.
4. **Binary Conversion:** Converting the rounded average to its binary representation using Python's built-in `bin()` function.
5. **Error Handling:** Checking if `n` is greater than `m` and returning `-1` in such cases.

### Tutorial

#### Range Calculation
The `range()` function in Python generates a sequence of numbers starting from `n` up to but not including `m+1`. This can be used to iterate over the range of numbers.

```python
# Example usage:
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
```

Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

#### Average Calculation
To calculate the average, you need to sum all the numbers in the range and divide by the count of numbers. In Python, you can use the `sum()` function along with `len()` to achieve this.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
total_sum = sum(numbers)
count = len(numbers)
average = total_sum / count
print(average)  # Output: 3.0
```

#### Rounding
Python's `round()` function rounds a number to the nearest integer.

```python
rounded_value = round(3.7)
print(rounded_value)  # Output: 4
```

#### Binary Conversion
The `bin()` function converts an integer to its binary representation as a string prefixed with '0b'.

```python
binary_representation = bin(5)
print(binary_representation)  # Output: '0b101'
```

#### Error Handling
Conditional statements are used to check if `n` is greater than `m` and handle this case appropriately.

```python
if n > m:
    print(-1)
else:
    print("Valid range")
```

##### Solution:
- Use a hash map to store the frequency of characters in the target substring.
- Slide a window of size equal to the length of the target substring across the main string.
- Compare the character frequencies in the current window with the target substring to find anagrams.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
1. **Check if `n` is greater than `m`:** If true, return `-1`.
2. **Calculate the sum of numbers from `n` to `m`:** Using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.
3. **Calculate the count of numbers from `n` to `m`:** Directly using `m - n + 1`.
4. **Compute the average:** Sum divided by count.
5. **Round the average:** Using Python¡¯s `round()` function.
6. **Convert to binary:** Using Python¡¯s `bin()` function.

#### Python3 Code to Solve the Problem

def rounded_avg(n, m):
    if n > m:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the sum of numbers from n to m
    total_sum = sum(range(n, m + 1))
    
    # Calculate the count of numbers from n to m
    count = m - n + 1
    
    # Compute the average
    average = total_sum / count
    
    # Round the average to the nearest integer
    rounded_average = round(average)
    
    # Convert the rounded average to binary
    binary_representation = bin(rounded_average)
    
    return binary_representation

# Test cases

Include the following points in your response:

- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

To solve this problem, we need to identify numbers that do not contain any even digits. This involves iterating through each number, checking its digits, and ensuring none of them are even. Once we have filtered out these numbers, we sort the resulting list before returning it.

## Tutorial:

### Checking for Even Digits

To check if a digit is even, we can use the modulus operator (`%`). A digit is even if `digit % 2 == 0`. We will iterate through each digit in a number and check this condition.

### Filtering Numbers

We will create a function that filters out numbers containing even digits from a given list. We will iterate through each number, convert it to a string to easily access individual digits, and check each digit using the even digit check mentioned above. If a number contains an even digit, it will be excluded from the result.

### Sorting

Finally, we need to sort the filtered list in ascending order. Python provides a built-in function called `sorted()` which we can use for this purpose.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Remove Even Digits from List

**Problem:** Given a list of positive integers, remove all numbers containing even digits and return the remaining numbers sorted.

**Solution:** Use a similar approach as in the original problem but without sorting the final list.

```python
def filter_even_digit_numbers(numbers):
    result = []
    for num in numbers:
        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

### Problem 2: Find Odd-Digit Numbers

**Problem:** Write a function that takes a range of integers and returns a list of odd-digit numbers within that range.

**Solution:** Iterate through the range, apply the same filtering logic as before, and collect the numbers.

```python
def find_odd_digit_numbers(start, end):
    result = []
    for num in range(start, end + 1):
        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):
            result.append(num)
    return result
```

### Problem 3: Unique Odd-Digit Numbers in Multiple Lists

**Problem:** Given multiple lists of positive integers, combine them into one list, filter out numbers with even digits, and return the sorted list of unique odd-digit numbers.

**Solution:** Combine the lists, apply the filtering logic, convert the result to a set to remove duplicates, and finally sort it.

```python
def unique_odd_digit_numbers(lists):
    combined = []
    for lst in lists:
        combined.extend(lst)
    result = []
    for num in combined:
        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):
            result.append(num)
    return sorted(set(result))
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

### Explanation of the Solution:

The solution iterates through each number in the input list, checks if all its digits are odd, and collects such numbers in a new list. Finally, it sorts the collected numbers and returns them.

### Python3 Code:

```python
def unique_digits(x):
    result = []
    for num in x:
        if all(int(digit) % 2 != 0 for digit in str(num)):
            result.append(num)
    return sorted(result)
```
completed 21/21, Solved: True, number of success = 16/21, acc = 76.19
