### Core Concepts and Algorithms

To solve this problem, we need to determine if the length of the intersection between two intervals is a prime number. Here are the key steps involved:

1. **Intersection Calculation**: First, we need to find the intersection of the two given intervals.
   - If one interval starts after the other ends, there is no intersection.
   - Otherwise, the intersection will be from the maximum of the start values to the minimum of the end values.

2. **Length of Intersection**: Once we have the intersection, we calculate its length. This is simply the difference between the end and start of the intersection plus one (since both endpoints are included).

3. **Prime Check**: Finally, we need to check if this length is a prime number. A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Tutorial on Algorithms

#### Intersection Calculation
Given two intervals `(a, b)` and `(c, d)`, the intersection can be calculated as follows:
- If `b < c` or `d < a`, there is no intersection.
- Otherwise, the intersection is `(max(a, c), min(b, d))`.

#### Length of Intersection
The length of the intersection `(x, y)` is `y - x + 1`.

#### Prime Check
A function to check if a number `n` is prime can be implemented using trial division up to the square root of `n`. If any number divides `n` evenly, then `n` is not prime.

### Example Problems

**Problem 1: Overlapping Intervals**
Given two intervals, determine if they overlap.

```python
def overlap(interval1, interval2):
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    return max(start1, start2) <= min(end1, end2)

# Example usage:
print(overlap((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # True
```

**Problem 2: Length of Intersection**
Given two intervals, calculate the length of their intersection.

```python
def intersection_length(interval1, interval2):
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    if overlap(interval1, interval2):
        return min(end1, end2) - max(start1, start2) + 1
    else:
        return 0

# Example usage:
print(intersection_length((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # 1
```

**Problem 3: Checking for Prime Numbers**
Given a number, determine if it is prime.

```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
print(is_prime(7))  # True
print(is_prime(8))  # False
```

### Solution to the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution**
1. Calculate the intersection of the two intervals.
2. Determine the length of the intersection.
3. Check if the length is a prime number.
4. Return "YES" if the length is prime, otherwise return "NO".

**Python3 Code**

```python
def intersection(interval1, interval2):
    start1, end1 = interval1
    start2, end2 = interval2
    
    # Calculate the intersection
    if start1 > end2 or start2 > end1:
        return "NO"
    
    intersection_start = max(start1, start2)
    intersection_end = min(end1, end2)
    
    # Calculate the length of the intersection
    intersection_length = intersection_end - intersection_start + 1
    
    # Check if the length is a prime number
    if intersection_length <= 1:
        return "NO"
    
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(intersection_length)) + 1):
        if intersection_length % i == 0:
            return "NO"
    
    return "YES"

# Example usage:
print(intersection((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # NO
print(intersection((-1, 1), (0, 4)))  # NO
print(intersection((-3, -1), (-5, 5)))  # YES
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above to determine if the length of the intersection of two intervals is a prime number.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
### Algorithms:
The core concept involved in solving this problem is determining the sign of the product of all elements in the array and calculating the sum of their absolute values. This involves iterating through the array to count the number of negative numbers and checking if there are any zeros, which would make the overall product zero.

### Tutorial:
#### Determining the Sign of the Product:
To determine the sign of the product of all elements in the array, we can follow these steps:
1. Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of negative numbers.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. If an element is negative, increment the counter.
4. If an element is zero, immediately return 0 since the product will be zero.
5. After the loop, check the parity of the counter:
   - If the counter is even, the product is positive.
   - If the counter is odd, the product is negative.

#### Sum of Absolute Values:
To calculate the sum of the absolute values of the elements in the array, we simply take the absolute value of each element and sum them up.

### Example Problems:
1. **Problem**: [Product of Array Except Self]
   - **Solution**: Calculate the product of all elements except the current one using two arrays, one for products before the current index and one for products after the current index.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def productExceptSelf(nums):
         n = len(nums)
         left_products = [1] * n
         right_products = [1] * n
         result = [1] * n
         
         for i in range(1, n):
             left_products[i] = left_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
         
         for i in reversed(range(n - 1)):
             right_products[i] = right_products[i + 1] * nums[i + 1]
         
         for i in range(n):
             result[i] = left_products[i] * right_products[i]
         
         return result
     ```

2. **Problem**: [Maximum Product Subarray]
   - **Solution**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum and minimum product at each step, considering the possibility of negative numbers flipping the sign.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def maxProduct(nums):
         if not nums:
             return 0
         
         max_product = min_product = result = nums[0]
         
         for num in nums[1:]:
             if num < 0:
                 max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product
             
             max_product = max(num, max_product * num)
             min_product = min(num, min_product * num)
             
             result = max(result, max_product)
         
         return result
     ```

3. **Problem**: [Sign of the Product of an Array]
   - **Solution**: Count the number of negative numbers and check for zeros to determine the sign of the product.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def arraySign(nums):
         if 0 in nums:
             return 0
         
         negative_count = sum(1 for num in nums if num < 0)
         
         return -1 if negative_count % 2 else 1
     ```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
#### Explanation of the Solution:
1. Check if the array is empty. If it is, return `None`.
2. Initialize a variable `sign` to 1 and a variable `sum_abs` to 0.
3. Iterate through the array:
   - If the element is zero, return 0 because the product will be zero.
   - If the element is negative, multiply `sign` by -1.
   - Add the absolute value of the element to `sum_abs`.
4. Return the product of `sign` and `sum_abs`.

#### Python3 Code:
```python
def prod_signs(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    
    sign = 1
    sum_abs = 0
    
    for num in arr:
        if num == 0:
            return 0
        elif num < 0:
            sign *= -1
        sum_abs += abs(num)
    
    return sign * sum_abs
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above and handles all edge cases as specified in the problem statement.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The core concept to solve this problem is **Depth-First Search (DFS)** combined with **Backtracking**. 

### DFS (Depth-First Search):

DFS is a traversal algorithm where we explore as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This is particularly useful when dealing with finding paths in a graph or grid.

### Backtracking:

Backtracking is a technique used to solve combinatorial problems. It involves trying out all possible configurations until a valid solution is found or all possibilities are exhausted. If a configuration does not lead to a valid solution, it is abandoned, and another one is tried.

## Tutorial:

1. **DFS Algorithm**:
   - Start at any given node (cell in our grid).
   - Move to adjacent nodes recursively until you reach a leaf node or a dead end.
   - Backtrack to the previous node and try the next unvisited node.

2. **Backtracking Technique**:
   - Maintain a current path that stores the sequence of visited cells.
   - Recursively try all possible paths from the current node.
   - If the path length equals `k`, check if it¡¯s lexicographically smaller than the best path found so far.
   - If the path is longer than `k` or leads to a larger lexicographical value, backtrack.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Minimum Path Sum in Grid

Given a grid of size `n x n`, find the minimum path sum from top-left to bottom-right.

#### Solution:
We use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to ensure we find the shortest path.

```python
from collections import deque

def minPathSum(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    queue = deque([(0, 0, grid[0][0])])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0)]
    
    while queue:
        x, y, path_sum = queue.popleft()
        if x == y == n - 1:
            return path_sum
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:
                queue.append((nx, ny, path_sum + grid[nx][ny]))
```

### Problem 2: Unique Paths II

Find the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right in a grid containing obstacles.

#### Solution:
Use DP to keep track of paths, considering obstacles.

```python
def uniquePathsII(obstacleGrid):
    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    dp[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0
    
    for i in range(1, m):
        if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]
    
    for j in range(1, n):
        if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0:
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]
    
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
    
    return dp[-1][-1]
```

### Problem 3: Maze II

Given a maze represented by a 2D grid where `0` represents walkable cells and `1` represents walls, find the shortest distance from the starting point to the exit using BFS.

#### Solution:
Use BFS to explore all possible paths and find the shortest one.

```python
from collections import deque

def nearestExit(maze, entrance):
    m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])
    queue = deque([entrance + [0]])
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    while queue:
        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()
        if (x == 0 or x == m-1 or y == 0 or y == n-1) and dist > 0:
            return dist
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and maze[nx][ny] == 0:
                maze[nx][ny] = 1
                queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))
                
    return -1
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

### Explanation:
We will use DFS to explore all possible paths of length `k` and keep track of the lexicographically smallest path.

### Python3 Code:

```python
def minPath(grid, k):
    def dfs(x, y, path, step):
        nonlocal result
        if step == k:
            if not result or path < result:
                result = path.copy()
            return
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:
                dfs(nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]], step + 1)
    
    n = len(grid)
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    result = None
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]], 1)
    
    return result
```

This code uses DFS to explore all possible paths of length `k` and keeps track of the lexicographically smallest path using a global variable `result`. The function iterates over every cell in the grid as a starting point and performs the DFS. Finally, it returns the smallest path found.

### Core Concepts

The Tribonacci sequence is an extension of the Fibonacci sequence where each term depends on the previous three terms rather than two. The problem involves generating the first `n+1` terms of this sequence based on specific rules:
- `tri(1) = 3`
- If `n` is even, `tri(n) = 1 + n / 2`
- If `n` is odd, `tri(n) = tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1)`

### Algorithms

To solve this problem, we need to implement the logic for generating the Tribonacci sequence up to the nth term. This involves:
1. Handling the base case where `n=1`.
2. Using recursion or iteration to compute the subsequent terms based on the given conditions.

### Tutorial

#### Recursion vs Iteration

**Recursion**: A function calls itself directly or indirectly. It's a natural fit for problems involving sequences where each term depends on the previous terms. However, recursion can lead to high memory usage and stack overflow issues for large inputs.

**Iteration**: Using loops (like `for` or `while`) to compute the sequence iteratively. This approach uses less memory but might be slightly more complex to implement.

For this problem, both approaches are feasible, but we'll use an iterative approach for simplicity and efficiency.

### Example Problems

1. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - **Problem**: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.
   - **Solution**: Use an iterative approach with dynamic programming to store intermediate results.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def fibonacci(n):
         fibs = [0, 1]
         for i in range(2, n + 1):
             fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
         return fibs[:n + 1]
     ```

2. **Lucas Sequence**
   - **Problem**: Generate the Lucas sequence up to the nth term.
   - **Solution**: Similar to Fibonacci, but starts with different initial values.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def lucas(n):
         lucas_values = [2, 1]
         for i in range(2, n + 1):
             lucas_values.append(lucas_values[-1] + lucas_values[-2])
         return lucas_values[:n + 1]
     ```

3. **Extended Tribonacci Sequence**
   - **Problem**: Extend the Tribonacci sequence to handle negative indices.
   - **Solution**: Use memoization to store computed values and handle negative indices using the recurrence relation.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def extended_tribonacci(n):
         memo = {1: 3}
         
         def tribonacci(k):
             if k in memo:
                 return memo[k]
             if k % 2 == 0:
                 result = 1 + k / 2
             else:
                 result = tribonacci(k - 1) + tribonacci(k - 2) + tribonacci(k + 1)
             memo[k] = result
             return result
         
         return [tribonacci(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
     ```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
We initialize a list `result` with the first element `[1]`. We then iterate from 2 to `n`, computing each term based on whether the current index is even or odd. We append each computed value to the `result` list.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def tri(n):
    # Initialize the result list with the first element
    result = [1]
    
    # Iterate from 2 to n to compute each term
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            # If i is even

### Core Concepts/Algorithms

The main concept in this problem is **iteration** and **conditional checks**. We need to iterate through each digit of the given number and check whether the digit is odd or even. If the digit is odd, we multiply it with an accumulator variable; otherwise, we skip it. At the end, if no odd digit was found, the function should return 0.

### Tutorial

#### Iteration
Iteration is a method of repeating a process until a certain condition is met. In Python, we can use loops for iteration. The two types of loops are `for` loop and `while` loop.

- **For Loop**: Used when the number of iterations is known or finite.
- **While Loop**: Used when the number of iterations is unknown but depends on a condition being true.

#### Conditional Checks
Conditional checks allow us to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. In Python, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to perform conditional checks.

Here¡¯s a simple tutorial on how to implement iteration and conditional checks in Python:

```python
# Example: Finding the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop
total = 0
for i in range(1, 11):
    total += i
print(total)  # Output: 55

# Example: Checking if a number is prime
def is_prime(num):
    if num <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(is_prime(7))  # Output: True
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Sum of Even Numbers
**Problem Statement**: Given a list of integers, return the sum of the even numbers.

**Solution**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and check if each number is even. If it is, add it to the sum.

```python
def sum_of_even_numbers(nums):
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Test cases
print(sum_of_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 6
print(sum_of_even_numbers([-2, 3, -4, 5]))  # Output: -6
```

#### Problem 2: Count Odd Characters in a String
**Problem Statement**: Given a string, count the number of characters that are odd.

**Solution**: Iterate through the string and check if each character is odd by converting it to its ASCII value and checking if it is odd.

```python
def count_odd_characters(s):
    count = 0
    for char in s:
        if ord(char) % 2 != 0:
            count += 1
    return count

# Test cases
print(count_odd_characters('abcde'))  # Output: 3
print(count_odd_characters('hello'))  # Output: 2
```

#### Problem 3: Find the Largest Even Number
**Problem Statement**: Given a list of integers, find the largest even number. Return -1 if there are no even numbers.

**Solution**: Initialize a variable to store the largest even number found so far. Iterate through the list and update the variable if a larger even number is found.

```python
def largest_even_number(nums):
    largest_even = -1
    for num in nums:
        if num % 2 == 0 and num > largest_even:
            largest_even = num
    return largest_even

# Test cases
print(largest_even_number([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4
print(largest_even_number([-2, 3, -4, 5]))  # Output: -2
print(largest_even_number([1, 3, 5]))  # Output: -1
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
We will iterate through each digit of the given number `n`. We'll convert the number to a string to easily access each digit. For each digit, we'll check if it's odd by converting it back to an integer and checking if it's not divisible by 2. If the digit is odd, we'll multiply it to a running product. If no odd digits are found, we'll return 0.

**Python3 Code**:

```python
def digits(n):
    product = 1
    has_odd = False
    for digit in str(n):
        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:
            product *= int(digit)
            has_odd = True
    return product if has_odd else 0

# Test cases
print(digits(1))  # Output: 1
print(digits(4))  # Output: 0
print(digits(235))  # Output: 15
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above, solving the original problem efficiently.

### Core Concepts / Algorithms

The problem requires us to compute the sum of squares of elements in a list after rounding them up to the nearest integer. The key steps involve:

1. **Rounding Up**: We need to round each number in the list to the nearest greater integer. This can be achieved using the ceiling function (`math.ceil`).
2. **Squaring**: After rounding up, we square each number.
3. **Summing**: Finally, we sum all the squared values.

### Tutorial

**Ceiling Function**: The ceiling function rounds a number up to the nearest whole number. In Python, this can be done using `math.ceil(number)` from the `math` module.

```python
import math

print(math.ceil(3.1))  # Output: 4
print(math.ceil(-1.5))  # Output: -1
```

**Squaring a Number**: Squaring a number means multiplying the number by itself. This can be done using the exponentiation operator `**`.

```python
number = 3
squared = number ** 2  # Output: 9
```

**Summing Elements**: To find the sum of elements in a list, you can use the built-in `sum()` function.

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3]
total_sum = sum(numbers)  # Output: 6
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Round Off Numbers and Sum Them

Given a list of integers, round off each number to the next higher integer and calculate their sum.

**Solution**:
- Round each number to the nearest higher integer using `math.ceil`.
- Sum the rounded numbers.

```python
def sum_rounded_numbers(lst):
    return sum(math.ceil(x) for x in lst)
```

**Example**:
```python
print(sum_rounded_numbers([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
```

#### Problem 2: Square and Sum

Given a list of integers, square each number and then sum them up.

**Solution**:
- Square each number using `x ** 2`.
- Sum the squared numbers.

```python
def sum_of_squares(lst):
    return sum(x ** 2 for x in lst)
```

**Example**:
```python
print(sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14
```

#### Problem 3: Combine Both Operations

Given a list of numbers, round each number up, square it, and then sum all the squared values.

**Solution**:
- Round each number to the nearest higher integer using `math.ceil`.
- Square each rounded number using `x ** 2`.
- Sum the squared numbers.

```python
def sum_squared_rounded(lst):
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)
```

**Example**:
```python
print(sum_squared_rounded([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation**:
- First, import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.
- Use a generator expression inside the `sum` function to apply `math.ceil` to each element in the list and then square it.
- Return the result.

```python
import math

def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    Calculate the sum of squares of elements in the list after rounding each element up.
    
    Args:
    lst (list): A list of numbers.
    
    Returns:
    int: The sum of squared numbers after rounding each element up.
    """
    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)

# Test cases
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14
print(sum_squares([1, 4, 9]))  # Output: 98
print(sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 84
print(sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0]))  # Output: 29
print(sum_squares([-2.4, 1, 1]))  # Output: 6
```

This code correctly implements the required functionality, ensuring that each element in the input list is rounded up before being squared and summed.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The key concept for solving this problem is **linear search**. We need to iterate through the array from left to right and compare each element with its immediate predecessor. The goal is to find the largest index where the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous one. If we don't find any such element, we return `-1`.

## Tutorial:
### Linear Search Algorithm:
Linear search is a simple sequential search algorithm that works by iterating over each element in a list until it finds the target element or exhausts all elements.

Here's how linear search works:
1. Start at the beginning of the array.
2. Compare the current element with the target value.
3. If they match, return the current index.
4. If they don¡¯t match, move to the next element.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the end of the array is reached.
6. If the target value is not found, return `-1`.

### Implementation in Python:
```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

## Example Problems:
### Problem 1: Find First Greater Element
**Problem:** Given an array, find the first element that is greater than its adjacent elements.

**Solution:** This problem involves finding the first instance where the current element is greater than both its neighbors. We can use linear search to traverse the array and check each element against its neighbors.

```python
def find_first_greater_element(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1] and arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            return arr[i]
    return None
```

### Problem 2: Check Sorted Array
**Problem:** Determine if an array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Solution:** We can use linear search to compare each element with its successor to ensure that each element is less than or equal to the next.

```python
def is_sorted(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        if arr[i] > arr[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Problem 3: Find Minimum Index Where Value is Not Equal to Index
**Problem:** Given an array of integers, find the smallest index `i` such that `arr[i] != i`. If no such index exists, return `-1`.

**Solution:** We can use linear search to iterate through the array and check each element against its index.

```python
def find_min_index_not_equal_to_value(arr):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] != i:
            return i
    return -1
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
To solve the original problem, we need to iterate through the array starting from the second element (index 1). For each element, we compare it with the element before it (`arr[i]` with `arr[i - 1]`). If we find an element that is not greater than or equal to its predecessor, we return the current index. If no such element is found after checking all elements, we return `-1`.

### Python3 Code:
```python
def can_arrange(arr):
    # Iterate through the array starting from the second element
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        # Check if the current element is not greater than or equal to the previous one
        if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            return i
    # If no such element is found, return -1
    return -1
```

This solution efficiently checks each element in the array exactly once, making it an O(n) operation where n is the length of the array.

 ## Algorithms:
The problem involves identifying the largest negative integer and the smallest positive integer from a given list. This can be achieved using iteration and conditional checks to filter out negative and positive integers separately.

### Tutorial:
1. **Iteration**: Traverse through the list to access each element.
2. **Conditional Checks**: Use conditional statements to check if an element is negative or positive.
3. **Tracking Largest Negative and Smallest Positive**:
   - Initialize variables to store the largest negative and smallest positive integers. Set these variables to `None` initially to handle cases where there might not be any negative or positive integers in the list.
   - As you iterate through the list, update these variables when you find elements that meet the criteria (largest negative or smallest positive).

             if nums[mid] == target:
                 start = mid
                 right = mid - 1

             if max_current > max_global:
                 max_global = max_current
         return max_global
     ```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize two variables, `max_neg` and `min_pos`, to `None`. These will hold the largest negative and smallest positive integers respectively.
2. **Iteration**: Loop through each number in the list.
3. **Conditionals**: Check if the current number is negative or positive. Update `max_neg` if the current number is larger than the current `max_neg`, and update `min_pos` if the current number is smaller than the current `min_pos`.
4. **Return**: Return a tuple containing `max_neg` and `min_pos`.

### Code:
```python
def largest_smallest_integers(lst):
    max_neg = None
    min_pos = None
    
    for num in lst:
        if num < 0:
            if max_neg is None or num > max_neg:
                max_neg = num
        elif num > 0:
            if min_pos is None or num < min_pos:
                min_pos = num
                
    return (max_neg, min_pos)
```

This code effectively finds the largest negative and smallest positive integers in the list by iterating through the list once and using simple conditional checks.

### Core Concepts/Algorithms

The core concept for this problem involves understanding the properties of even numbers and how they can be combined to form sums. Specifically, we need to determine if a given number `n` can be expressed as the sum of exactly four positive even integers. 

### Tutorial

**Even Numbers**: An integer is considered even if it is divisible by 2 without leaving a remainder. Mathematically, an even number can be represented as \(2k\) where \(k\) is an integer.

**Sum of Even Numbers**: The sum of two even numbers is always even because:
- If \(a = 2m\) and \(b = 2n\), then \(a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m+n)\), which is also an even number.

**Key Insight**: To find out if a number \(n\) can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers, consider the smallest possible sum of four positive even numbers, which is \(2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 8\). Any number smaller than 8 cannot be formed by such a sum. Additionally, since the sum of any four even numbers is even, \(n\) must also be even for it to be expressible in this form.

### Example Problems

1. **Problem**: [Check if Number Can Be Summed by Four Even Numbers]
   - **Description**: Given a number `n`, check if it can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers.
   - **Solution**: A number can be written as the sum of four positive even numbers if and only if it is even and greater than or equal to 8.
     ```python
     def can_be_sum_of_four_evens(n):
         return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
     ```

2. **Problem**: [Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Equal]
   - **Description**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine the minimum number of steps required to make them equal by swapping characters between them.
   - **Solution**: This problem involves counting the frequency of each character in both strings and ensuring they match.
     ```python
     from collections import Counter

     def min_steps(s, t):
         count_s = Counter(s)
         count_t = Counter(t)
         result = 0
         for char in set(count_s.keys()).union(set(count_t.keys())):
             result += abs(count_s[char] - count_t[char])
         return result // 2
     ```

3. **Problem**: [Maximum Product Subarray]
   - **Description**: Given an array of integers, find the contiguous subarray within the array that has the largest product.
   - **Solution**: This problem requires keeping track of the maximum and minimum products up to the current position because a negative number could turn a small product into a large one.
     ```python
     def max_product_subarray(nums):
         if not nums:
             return 0

             max_prod = temp_max

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution**:
To determine if a number \(n\) can be written as the sum of exactly four positive even numbers, we need to check if \(n\) is even and at least 8. This is because the smallest sum of four positive even numbers is 8 (\(2+2+2+2=8\)) and all such sums are even.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def is_equal_to_sum_even(n):
    """Evaluate whether the given number n can be written as the sum of exactly 4 positive even numbers
    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True
    """
    return n >= 8 and n % 2 == 0
```

This function checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 8 and if it is even. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Core Concepts in the Problem

The problem involves calculating the "Brazilian factorial" of a given number `n`. The Brazilian factorial is defined as the product of all factorials from `n` down to `1`. For instance, if `n` is 4, the Brazilian factorial would be calculated as follows:

\[ \text{brazilian\_factorial}(4) = 4! \times 3! \times 2! \times 1! = 24 \times 6 \times 2 \times 1 = 288 \]

To solve this, we need to:
1. Calculate the factorial for each number from `n` down to `1`.
2. Multiply all these factorials together to get the result.

### Algorithm

1. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - Create a helper function `factorial(num)` that calculates the factorial of a single number using a loop.
   
2. **Iterate and Multiply**:
   - Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
   - Loop from `n` down to `1`, calculate the factorial of the current number using the helper function, and multiply it with `result`.

### Tutorial

#### Factorial Calculation
A factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It's denoted by `n!`.

For example, \(5!\) (5 factorial) is:
\[ 5! = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 = 120 \]

We can implement this in Python using a simple loop:

```python
def factorial(num):
    if num == 0 or num == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, num + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
```

#### Iterating and Multiplying
Once we have a function to calculate the factorial of a number, we can use it to compute the Brazilian factorial by iterating from `n` down to `1` and multiplying the results.

Here¡¯s how you can do it:

```python
def brazilian_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result
```

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Factorial of a Number
**Problem**: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.
**Solution**:
```python
def factorial(num):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

# Test cases
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
print(factorial(7))  # Output: 5040
```

#### Problem 2: Sum of Factorials
**Problem**: Write a function to calculate the sum of factorials of numbers from 1 to `n`.
**Solution**:
```python
def sum_of_factorials(n):
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_sum += factorial(i)
    return total_sum

# Test cases
print(sum_of_factorials(3))  # Output: 9 (1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9)
print(sum_of_factorials(4))  # Output: 33 (1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33)
```

#### Problem 3: Brazilian Factorial of a Number
**Problem**: Write a function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given number.
**Solution**:
```python
def brazilian_factorial(n):
    def factorial(num):
        result = 1
        for i in range(2, num + 1):
            result *= i
        return result
    
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

# Test cases
print(brazilian_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
print(brazilian_factorial(5))  # Output: 34560
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
- We define a helper function `factorial(num)` to calculate the factorial of a single number.
- In the main function `special_factorial(n)`, we initialize a variable `result` to 1.
- We iterate from `n` down to `1`, calculate the factorial of the current number, and multiply it with `result`.

#### Python3 Code

```python
def factorial(num):
    result = 1
    for i in range(2, num + 1):
        result *= i
    return result

def special_factorial(n):
    result = 1
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        result *= factorial(i)
    return result

# Test cases
print(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288
print(special_factorial(5))  # Output: 34560
```

This code correctly implements the logic to calculate the Brazilian factorial as described in the problem statement.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept used to solve this problem involves iterating through the characters of the given string and replacing them based on their type (space or non-space). Additionally, we need to handle the special case where there are more than two consecutive spaces, which should be replaced with a hyphen (-) instead of multiple underscores (_).

## Tutorial:
### Iteration and Condition Checking:
Iteration allows us to go through each character in the string one by one. We can use a simple `for` loop for this purpose. For each character, we need to check if it's a space or not using an `if` statement.

### String Concatenation:
We will build our resulting string by concatenating characters as we iterate through the original string. This can be done using the `+=` operator, which appends a value to the end of a string.

### Handling Consecutive Spaces:
To handle consecutive spaces, we need a counter that increments every time we encounter a space and resets when a non-space character is encountered. If the counter exceeds 2, we append a hyphen to our result string; otherwise, we append an underscore.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Replace All Spaces in a String
**Problem:** Write a function `replace_spaces(input_string)` that replaces all spaces in `input_string` with underscores (_) without considering any conditions.
```python
def replace_spaces(input_string):
    result = ""
    for char in input_string:
        if char == " ":
            result += "_"
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

### Problem 2: Replace Multiple Consecutive Characters
**Problem:** Implement a function `replace_consecutive_chars(input_string, max_count, replacement_char)` that replaces sequences of `max_count` or more occurrences of the same character with `replacement_char`.
```python
def replace_consecutive_chars(input_string, max_count, replacement_char):
    result = []
    count = 0
    prev_char = None
    for char in input_string:
        if char != prev_char:
            count = 1
            prev_char = char
        else:
            count += 1
        
        if count <= max_count:
            result.append(char)
        else:
            result.append(replacement_char)
    
    return "".join(result)
```

### Problem 3: Simplified Version of the Original Problem
**Problem:** Modify the original problem to only replace spaces with underscores and remove the condition for handling more than two consecutive spaces.
```python
def simplified_fix_spaces(text):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char == " ":
            result += "_"
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:
### Explanation of the Solution:
- We initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.
- We iterate through each character `char` in the input string `text`.
- If `char` is a space, we append an underscore `_` to `result`.
- If `char` is not a space, we simply append `char` to `result`.
- Finally, we return the `result` string.

### Python3 Code:
```python
def fix_spaces(text):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char == " ":
            result += "_"
        else:
            result += char
    return result

print(fix_spaces("Example"))  # Output: "Example"
print(fix_spaces("Example 1"))  # Output: "Example_1"
print(fix_spaces(" Example 2"))  # Output: "_Example_2"
print(fix_spaces(" Example   3"))  # Output: "_Example-3"
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above and solves the given problem efficiently.

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

The problem involves validating a file's name based on specific criteria. Here are the key concepts and algorithms we need to use:

1. **String Manipulation**: We need to work with substrings and their properties.
2. **Character Checking**: We need to check if characters are letters or digits.
3. **Counting Digits**: We need to count the number of digits in the filename.
4. **Validation Rules**:
   - Check if there is exactly one dot (`.`) in the filename.
   - Ensure the part before the dot starts with an alphabet character.
   - Ensure the part after the dot is one of the allowed extensions: `['txt', 'exe', 'dll']`.
   - Count the number of digits in the filename and ensure it does not exceed three.

### Tutorial

#### String Manipulation
- **Slicing**: Extracting parts of a string using slicing.
- **Splitting**: Dividing a string into parts based on a delimiter.

#### Character Checking
- **isalpha()**: Checks if a character is an alphabet letter.
- **isdigit()**: Checks if a character is a digit.

#### Counting Digits
- Use a loop to iterate through the string and count digits.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Validate Email Address
Given a string, determine if it is a valid email address.
```python
def validate_email(email):
    parts = email.split('@')
    if len(parts) != 2:
        return False
    local, domain = parts
    if '.' not in local or not local[0].isalpha():
        return False
    return any(domain.endswith(ext) for ext in ['.com', '.org', '.net'])
```

#### Problem 2: Check Palindrome
Determine if a given string is a palindrome.
```python
def is_palindrome(s):
    s = ''.join(c.lower() for c in s if c.isalnum())
    return s == s[::-1]
```

#### Problem 3: URL Validator
Check if a given string is a valid URL.
```python
import re

def validate_url(url):
    pattern = r'^https?://[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}(:\d+)?(/.*)?$'
    return bool(re.match(pattern, url))
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
1. Split the filename at the dot to get the prefix and extension.
2. Check if there is exactly one dot.
3. Verify that the prefix starts with a letter.
4. Ensure the extension is one of `['txt', 'exe', 'dll']`.
5. Count the number of digits and ensure it does not exceed three.

#### Python3 Code
```python
def file_name_check(file_name):
    # Split the filename at the dot
    parts = file_name.split('.')
    
    # Check if there is exactly one dot
    if len(parts) != 2:
        return 'No'
    
    prefix, extension = parts
    
    # Check if the prefix starts with a letter
    if not prefix or not prefix[0].isalpha():
        return 'No'
    
    # Check if the extension is valid
    valid_extensions = {'txt', 'exe', 'dll'}
    if extension not in valid_extensions:
        return 'No'
    
    # Count the number of digits in the filename
    num_digits = sum(c.isdigit() for c in file_name)
    
    # Check if the number of digits does not exceed three
    if num_digits > 3:

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Core Concepts:

The problem requires iterating over a list and applying different operations based on the index of each element. Specifically, elements at indices divisible by 3 are squared, elements at indices divisible by 4 but not by 3 are cubed, and no changes are made to other elements. The final step is to sum up all the modified elements.

### Algorithm:
1. Initialize a variable to hold the sum.
2. Iterate through the list using enumeration to get both the index and value.
3. Apply the appropriate operation based on whether the index is divisible by 3 or 4:
   - If the index is divisible by 3, square the value.
   - If the index is divisible by 4, cube the value.
   - Otherwise, keep the value unchanged.
4. Add the transformed value to the sum.
5. Return the sum after processing all elements.

### Tutorial:
This algorithm involves basic iteration, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and list manipulation. It's a great way to practice handling lists and performing calculations conditionally based on array positions.

### Relevant Competitive Programming Problems:

#### Problem 1: Array Transformation
**Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers, transform the array according to the following rules: square elements at even indices, cube elements at odd indices, and leave them as is otherwise. Sum all the elements after transformation.

**Solution:** Use a loop to iterate through the array, apply the conditions, and accumulate the result.

```python
def transform_and_sum(arr):
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(arr):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            total += num ** 2
        else:
            total += num ** 3
    return total
```

#### Problem 2: Special Index Operations
**Problem Statement:** For a given list, double elements at multiples of 5, triple elements at multiples of 7, and subtract 1 from other elements. Calculate the sum of the transformed list.

**Solution:** Iterate through the list, apply the conditions, and update the sum accordingly.

```python
def special_operations(lst):
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 5 == 0:
            total += num * 2
        elif i % 7 == 0:
            total += num * 3
        else:
            total += num - 1
    return total
```

#### Problem 3: Conditional Squaring and Cubing
**Problem Statement:** Implement a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum. Square numbers at multiples of 9 and cube numbers at multiples of 11. Leave other numbers unchanged.

**Solution:** Iterate through the list, apply the conditions, and compute the sum.

```python
def complex_transform(lst):
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 9 == 0:
            total += num ** 2
        elif i % 11 == 0:
            total += num ** 3
        else:
            total += num
    return total
```

## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

### Explanation of the Solution:
- We initialize `total` to store the cumulative sum.
- We use a loop with enumeration to access both the index (`i`) and the value (`num`) of each element in the list.
- We check if the index is divisible by 3. If so, we square the number.
- We check if the index is divisible by 4 but not by 3. If so, we cube the number.
- We add the transformed number to `total`.
- Finally, we return the computed sum.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Problem:

```python
def sum_squares(lst):
    total = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(lst):
        if i % 3 == 0:
            total += num ** 2
        elif i % 4 == 0:
            total += num ** 3
        else:
            total += num
    return total

# Test cases
print(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6
print(sum_squares([]))         # Output: 0
print(sum_squares([-1, -5, 2, -1, -5]))  # Output: -126
```

This code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles various edge cases, including empty lists.

### Core Concepts

The problem requires us to filter out words from a sentence based on whether their lengths are prime numbers. The key steps involved are:
1. Splitting the sentence into individual words.
2. Checking if the length of each word is a prime number.
3. Constructing a new sentence from the words that meet the prime-length criterion.

To achieve this, we need:
- A function to split a string into words.
- A function to check if a number is prime.
- A function to construct a sentence from a list of words.

### Algorithms

#### 1. Splitting a String into Words
This can be done using Python's built-in `split()` method, which splits a string into a list of substrings based on whitespace.

#### 2. Checking if a Number is Prime
A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if a number is prime:
- If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.
- Iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number and check if the number is divisible by any of these values. If it is, the number is not prime.

#### 3. Constructing a Sentence from a List of Words
This can be done using the `join()` method, which concatenates elements of an iterable into a single string with a specified separator.

### Tutorial

#### Splitting a String into Words
```python
sentence = "Hello World"
words = sentence.split()  # ['Hello', 'World']
```

#### Checking if a Number is Prime
```python
import math

def is_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

print(is_prime(5))  # True
print(is_prime(4))  # False
```

#### Constructing a Sentence from a List of Words
```python
words = ['Hello', 'World']
sentence = ' '.join(words)  # 'Hello World'
```

### Example Problems

**Problem 1:** [Prime Length Words]
Given a sentence, return a string containing words with prime lengths.

**Solution:**
1. Split the sentence into words.
2. Filter words where the length is prime.
3. Join the filtered words back into a sentence.

**Python Code:**
```python
def prime_length_words(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_words)
```

**Problem 2:** [Count Prime Length Substrings]
Given a string, count the number of substrings with prime lengths.

**Solution:**
1. Generate all possible substrings.
2. Check if the length of each substring is prime.
3. Count the substrings that are prime-length.

**Python Code:**
```python
def count_prime_length_substrings(s):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start + 1, n + 1):
            if is_prime(end - start):
                count += 1
    return count
```

**Problem 3:** [Minimum Window Substring Containing All Primes]
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the minimum window in `s` that contains all characters in `t`.

**Solution:**
1. Use a sliding window approach to find the smallest window in `s` that contains all characters in `t`.
2. Ensure the window size is within the prime length constraint.

**Python Code:**
```python
from collections import Counter

def min_window_substring(s, t):
    target_count = Counter(t)
    formed = 0
    required = len(target_count)
    
    left = 0
    right = 0
    window_counts = {}
    
    ans = float('inf'), None, None
    
    while right < len(s):
        character = s[right]
        window_counts[character] = window_counts.get(character, 0) + 1
        
        if character in target_count and window_counts[character] == target_count[character]:
            formed += 1
        
        while left <= right and formed == required:
            character = s[left]
            
            if right - left + 1 < ans[0]:
                ans = (right - left + 1, left, right)
            
            window_counts[character] -= 1
            if character in target_count and window_counts[character] < target_count[character]:
                formed -= 1
            
            left += 1
        
        right += 1
    
    return '' if ans[0] == float('inf') else s[ans[1]: ans[2] + 1]
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

**Explanation of the Solution:**

1. **Split the sentence into words**: We use the `split()` method to break the sentence into individual words.
2. **Filter words with prime lengths**: We define a helper function `is_prime` to check if the length of a word is prime. We iterate through the list of words and keep only those whose lengths are prime.
3. **Join the filtered words back into a sentence**: We use the `join()` method to concatenate the remaining words into a single string.

**Python3 Code:**

```python
def words_in_sentence(sentence):
    def is_prime(n):
        if n < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                return False
        return True
    
    words = sentence.split()
    prime_words = [word for word in words if is_prime(len(word))]
    return ' '.join(prime_words)
```

This code will correctly filter and return words from the input sentence whose lengths are prime numbers.

### Core Concepts:
The core concept here involves understanding how to multiply two fractions and determine if the result is an integer. To achieve this, we need to perform the multiplication of the numerators together and the denominators together. If the resulting fraction's numerator is divisible by its denominator without any remainder, then the result is an integer.

### Algorithms:
1. **Fraction Multiplication**: Multiply the numerators together and the denominators together.
2. **Integer Check**: Check if the numerator of the resulting fraction is divisible by its denominator.

### Tutorial:
#### Fraction Multiplication:
To multiply two fractions \( \frac{a}{b} \) and \( \frac{c}{d} \), follow these steps:
1. Multiply the numerators: \( a \times c \).
2. Multiply the denominators: \( b \times d \).

So, \( \frac{a}{b} \times \frac{c}{d} = \frac{a \times c}{b \times d} \).

#### Integer Check:
To check if a fraction \( \frac{n}{d} \) represents an integer, simply check if \( n \% d == 0 \). If true, the fraction is an integer; otherwise, it is not.

### Example Problems:

   - **Description**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
   - **Solution**: This problem does not directly involve fraction operations but uses stack-based logic which is a common algorithm in competitive programming.
   
3. **Problem**: [CodeChef - Problem FLOW001 - Sum of Two Numbers](https://www.codechef.com/problems/FLOW001)
   - **Description**: Given two integers, compute their sum.
   - **Solution**: This is a basic arithmetic operation, not related to fractions, but serves as a simple example of handling input/output in competitive programming.

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:
```python
def gcd(a, b):
    """Helper function to calculate the greatest common divisor."""
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def simplify(x, n):
    # Splitting the fractions into numerator and denominator
    num_x, denom_x = map(int, x.split('/'))
    num_n, denom_n = map(int, n.split('/'))

    # Multiplying the fractions
    num_result = num_x * num_n
    denom_result = denom_x * denom_n

    # Simplifying the resulting fraction
    common_divisor = gcd(num_result, denom_result)
    num_result //= common_divisor
    denom_result //= common_divisor

    # Checking if the result is an integer
    return num_result % denom_result == 0

# Test cases
print(simplify("1/5", "5/1"))  # Output: True
print(simplify("1/6", "2/1"))  # Output: False
print(simplify("7/10", "10/2")) # Output: False

### Algorithms:

The core concept used to solve this problem is **Sorting**. Specifically, we need to sort the list of integers based on the sum of their digits while maintaining their original order for numbers with the same digit sum. This requires using a stable sorting algorithm since the relative order of equal elements should not change.

### Tutorial:

#### Sorting Algorithms:

1. **Stable Sorting**: A sorting algorithm is considered stable if it maintains the relative order of records with equal keys (values). For example, consider the array `[5, 2, 2, 8]`. After sorting, the array remains `[2, 2, 5, 8]`, maintaining the original order of the two `2`s.

2. **Digit Sum Calculation**: To calculate the sum of digits of an integer, you can convert the number to a string, iterate through each character, convert it back to an integer, and sum them up. Handle negative numbers by first taking their absolute value.

### Example Problems:

1. **Problem: Sort Array by Frequency**
   - **Description**: Given an array of integers, sort them by frequency. If two numbers have the same frequency, they should remain in their original order.
   - **Solution**: Use a custom sorting key where the primary factor is frequency and the secondary factor is the original index.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     from collections import Counter

     def sort_by_frequency(arr):
         count = Counter(arr)
         return sorted(arr, key=lambda x: (-count[x], arr.index(x)))
     ```

2. **Problem: Sort Strings by Their Lengths**
   - **Description**: Given a list of strings, sort them by their lengths. If two strings have the same length, maintain their original order.
   - **Solution**: Use the built-in `sorted` function with a key that returns the length of the string.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def sort_strings_by_length(strings):
         return sorted(strings, key=len)
     ```

3. **Problem: Sort Points by Distance from Origin**
   - **Description**: Given a list of points represented as tuples `(x, y)`, sort them by their Euclidean distance from the origin `(0, 0)`. If two points have the same distance, maintain their original order.
   - **Solution**: Calculate the square of the distance (to avoid computing the square root) and use it as the sorting key.
   - **Code**:
     ```python
     def sort_points_by_distance(points):
         return sorted(points, key=lambda p: p[0]**2 + p[1]**2)
     ```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:

#### Explanation of the Solution:

1. **Sum of Digits Function**: Create a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of an integer.
2. **Custom Key for Sorting**: Use this helper function within a custom key for the `sorted` function. The key will be a tuple where the first element is the sum of digits (for sorting), and the second element is the original index (to maintain order for equal sums).

#### Python3 Code:

```python
def order_by_points(nums):
    # Helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number
    def sum_of_digits(num):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(abs(num)))

    # Custom key for sorting: (sum of digits, original index)
    return sorted(nums, key=lambda x: (sum_of_digits(x), nums.index(x)))

# Test cases
print(order_by_points([1, 11, -1, -11, -12]))  # Output: [-1, -11, 1, -12, 11]
print(order_by_points([]))                     # Output: []
```

This code defines a function `order_by_points` that sorts a list of integers based on the sum of their digits while maintaining their original order for equal sums. The solution uses a custom key for the `sorted` function and includes a helper function to compute the sum of digits.

### Core Concepts and Algorithms

To solve the given problem, we need to filter numbers based on two conditions:
1. The number must be greater than 10.
2. Both the first and last digits of the number must be odd (1, 3, 5, 7, 9).

We can achieve this using a combination of list filtering and string manipulation techniques in Python.

### Tutorial

#### List Filtering
List filtering allows us to create a new list containing only those elements from the original list that satisfy a certain condition. This can be done using list comprehensions or the `filter` function.

#### String Manipulation
String manipulation involves operations on strings such as accessing individual characters, slicing, and converting numbers to strings. In our case, we need to convert numbers to strings to easily access their first and last digits.

### Example Problems

#### Problem 1: Filter Odd Numbers
**Problem:** Write a function that filters out even numbers from a list and returns a list of only odd numbers.
```python
def filter_odd_numbers(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 != 0]
```

#### Problem 2: Reverse Words in a Sentence
**Problem:** Write a function that takes a sentence and returns a new sentence with all words reversed.
```python
def reverse_words(sentence):
    return ' '.join(word[::-1] for word in sentence.split())
```

#### Problem 3: Find Common Elements
**Problem:** Write a function that takes two lists and returns a list of common elements.
```python
def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    return list(set(list1) & set(list2))
```

### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem

#### Explanation of the Solution
1. **Check if Number is Greater Than 10:** We use a simple conditional check (`if num > 10`) to ensure the number meets this criterion.
2. **Convert Number to String:** We convert the number to a string to easily access its first and last digits.
3. **Check Odd Digits:** We check if both the first and last digits are odd by converting them back to integers and checking if they are in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`.
4. **Count Valid Numbers:** We count how many numbers meet both criteria using a generator expression within the `sum` function.

#### Python3 Code to Solve the Problem
```python
def specialFilter(nums):
    # Convert each number to a string to easily access first and last digits
    nums_str = [str(num) for num in nums if num > 10]
    
    # Check if first and last digits are odd
    valid_nums = [num for num in nums_str if int(num[0]) % 2 != 0 and int(num[-1]) % 2 != 0]
    
    # Return the count of valid numbers
    return len(valid_nums)
```

This code correctly implements the logic described above and should work efficiently for the given problem.
