  The Hat is a game of speedy explanation/guessing words (similar to Alias). It's fun. Try it! In this problem, we are talking about a variant of the game when the players are sitting at the table and everyone plays individually (i.e. not teams, but individual gamers play).$$$n$$$ people gathered in a room with $$$m$$$ tables ($$$n \ge 2m$$$). They want to play the Hat $$$k$$$ times. Thus, $$$k$$$ games will be played at each table. Each player will play in $$$k$$$ games.To do this, they are distributed among the tables for each game. During each game, one player plays at exactly one table. A player can play at different tables.Players want to have the most "fair" schedule of games. For this reason, they are looking for a schedule (table distribution for each game) such that:  At any table in each game there are either $$$\lfloor\frac{n}{m}\rfloor$$$ people or $$$\lceil\frac{n}{m}\rceil$$$ people (that is, either $$$n/m$$$ rounded down, or $$$n/m$$$ rounded up). Different numbers of people can play different games at the same table. Let's calculate for each player the value $$$b_i$$$ ！ the number of times the $$$i$$$-th player played at a table with $$$\lceil\frac{n}{m}\rceil$$$ persons ($$$n/m$$$ rounded up). Any two values of $$$b_i$$$must differ by no more than $$$1$$$. In other words, for any two players $$$i$$$ and $$$j$$$, it must be true $$$|b_i - b_j| \le 1$$$. For example, if $$$n=5$$$, $$$m=2$$$ and $$$k=2$$$, then at the request of the first item either two players or three players should play at each table. Consider the following schedules:  First game: $$$1, 2, 3$$$ are played at the first table, and $$$4, 5$$$ at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play $$$5, 1$$$, and at the second \xa0！ $$$2, 3, 4$$$. This schedule is not "fair" since $$$b_2=2$$$ (the second player played twice at a big table) and $$$b_5=0$$$ (the fifth player did not play at a big table). First game: $$$1, 2, 3$$$ are played at the first table, and $$$4, 5$$$ at the second one. The second game: at the first table they play $$$4, 5, 2$$$, and at the second one \xa0！ $$$1, 3$$$. This schedule is "fair": $$$b=[1,2,1,1,1]$$$ (any two values of $$$b_i$$$ differ by no more than $$$1$$$). Find any "fair" game schedule for $$$n$$$ people if they play on the $$$m$$$ tables of $$$k$$$ games.
