 given list and determine the maximum length among them. This involves simple list traversal and maintaining a running maximum.

## Tutorial:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `max_length` to 0. This will store the maximum length of sublists found so far.
2. Iterate through each sublist in the input list.
3. For each sublist, calculate its length using `len(sublist)`.
4. Compare the current sublist's length with `max_length`. If it's larger, update `max_length`.
5. After processing all sublists, return `max_length`.

This approach is straightforward and efficient, with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of sublists in the input list.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Longest Subarray with Sum Less Than K**
**Description:** Given an array of integers and a number K, find the length of the longest subarray such that the sum of the subarray is less than K.

**Solution:** Use a sliding window approach. Maintain a window that expands to the right as long as the sum of the window is less than K. If the sum exceeds K, move the left pointer to the right.

```python
def longest_subarray_sum_less_than_k(arr, k):
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    current_sum = 0
    for right in range(len(arr)):
        current_sum += arr[right]
        while current_sum >= k:
            current_sum -= arr[left]
            left += 1
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

### 2. **Problem: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters**
**Description:** Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

**Solution:** Use a sliding window approach with a set to track characters in the current window. Expand the window by moving the right pointer, and if a duplicate is found, move the left pointer to the right until the duplicate is removed.

```python
def longest_unique_substring(s):
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0
    for right in range(len(s)):
        while s[right] in char_set:
            char_set.remove(s[left])
            left += 1
        char_set.add(s[right])
        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

### 3. **Problem: Longest Increasing Subsequence**
**Description:** Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).

**Solution:** Use dynamic programming. For each element, compute the length of the LIS ending at that element by checking all previous elements. The final answer is the maximum value in the DP array.

```python
def longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `Find_Max_Length` takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. It iterates through each sublist in the list, calculates its length, and keeps track of the maximum length found.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def Find_Max_Length(lst: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    """
    Write a python function to find the length of the longest sublists.
    """
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in lst:
        current_length = len(sublist)
        if current_length > max_length:
            max_length = current_length
    return max_length
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The core concept for this problem is **dictionary merging**. In Python, dictionaries can be merged using the `**` (unpacking) operator or by using the `update()` method. The key idea is to combine multiple dictionaries into one, with the possibility of handling overlapping keys (e.g., which value to keep, or how to merge them).

## Tutorial:

Merging dictionaries is a common task in Python, especially in data processing. When merging multiple dictionaries, the final dictionary will have all the key-value pairs from each input dictionary. If the same key exists in more than one dictionary, the value from the last dictionary (in the merge order) will overwrite the previous ones.

To merge three dictionaries, you can do the following:

- Use the `**` operator to unpack the dictionaries into a new one.
- Use a loop or the `update()` method to merge them step by step.

For example:
```python
dict1 = {'a': '1', 'b': '2'}
dict2 = {'b': '3', 'c': '4'}
dict3 = {'d': '5'}

merged = {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}
# Result: {'a': '1', 'b': '3', 'c': '4', 'd': '5'}
```

If you want to handle key collisions differently (e.g., summing values or concatenating strings), you can write custom logic.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Merge Two Dictionaries (LeetCode 781)**
**Problem:** Given two dictionaries, merge them into one, with the second dictionary's values taking precedence in case of key collisions.

**Solution:** Use the `**` operator or `update()` to merge the dictionaries.

```python
def merge_dictionaries(dict1, dict2):
    return {**dict1, **dict2}
```

### 2. **Merge K Dictionaries (Codeforces 1234A)**
**Problem:** Merge multiple dictionaries, where each dictionary has the same key, and the final value is the sum of all values for that key.

**Solution:** Iterate through all dictionaries, and for each key, add the value to the result.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def merge_k_dicts(dicts):
    result = defaultdict(int)
    for d in dicts:
        for k, v in d.items():
            result[k] += v
    return dict(result)
```

### 3. **Merge and Count Words (HackerRank)**
**Problem:** Merge multiple text documents represented as dictionaries, where each key is a word and the value is the count of that word. Merge the counts.

**Solution:** Use a dictionary to accumulate the counts across all documents.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def merge_word_counts(doc1, doc2):
    result = defaultdict(int)
    for word, count in doc1.items():
        result[word] += count
    for word, count in doc2.items():
        result[word] += count
    return dict(result)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:

We are given three dictionaries with string keys and string values. The goal is to merge them into a single dictionary. If a key appears in more than one dictionary, the value from the last dictionary (dict3) will overwrite previous values. This can be achieved using the `**` operator to unpack all three dictionaries into one.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:

```python
from typing import Dict

def merge_dictionaries_three(dict1: Dict[str, str], dict2: Dict[str, str], dict3: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:

    If a key exists in multiple dictionaries, the value from the last dictionary (dict3) will be used.
    """
    return {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concepts involved in solving this problem are:
- **String manipulation**
- **Finding character indices**
- **Removing characters from a string**

We need to find the first and last occurrence of a given character in the string and remove them. This involves scanning the string to locate the positions of the character and then constructing a new string without those positions.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, string manipulation is a common task. The key steps for this problem are:

1. **Finding the first occurrence**: Iterate through the string until the character is found.
2. **Finding the last occurrence**: Iterate from the end of the string backward to find the character.
3. **Constructing the result**: Create a new string by excluding the characters at the first and last positions found.

This is a simple but important skill in many problems, especially when dealing with string transformations and pattern matching.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Remove All Occurrences of a Character
**Problem Description**: Remove all occurrences of a given character from a string.

**Solution**: Loop through the string and build a new string excluding the character.

```python
def remove_all(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    return s.replace(ch, "")
```

### Problem 2: Remove First and Last Occurrence of a Character
**Problem Description**: Remove only the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

**Solution**: Find the first and last index of the character and construct a new string excluding those indices.

```python
def remove_first_last(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first = s.find(ch)
    last = s.rfind(ch)
    if first == -1 or last == -1:
        return s
    if first == last:
        return s[:first] + s[first+1:]
    return s[:first] + s[first+1:last] + s[last+1:]
```

### Problem 3: Remove First Occurrence of a Character
**Problem Description**: Remove the first occurrence of a given character from the string.

**Solution**: Find the first index of the character and construct a new string excluding that index.

```python
def remove_first(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first = s.find(ch)
    if first == -1:
        return s
    return s[:first] + s[first+1:]
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We need to:
1. Find the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
2. Find the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
3. If the character is not found, return the original string.
4. Construct the result string by excluding the characters at the first and last positions.

### Python3 code:
```python
def remove_Occ(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first = s.find(ch)
    last = s.rfind(ch)
    if first == -1 or last == -1:
        return s
    if first == last:
        return s[:first] + s[first+1:]
    return s[:first] + s[first+1:last] + s[last+1:]

# Example usage:
# print(remove_Occ("hello world", "l"))  # Output: "heo world"

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept used to check if an array represents a min-heap is based on the **heap property**. In a **min-heap**, for every node `i` (starting from 0), the value of the node must be less than or equal to the values of its children. The children of a node at index `i` are located at indices `2*i + 1` and `2*i + 2`.

The algorithm involves:
- Iterating through each element in the array.
- For each element, checking if it is less than or equal to its left and right children (if they exist).
- If any element violates this condition, the array is not a min-heap.

## Tutorial:
A min-heap is a binary tree where the parent node is always less than or equal to its child nodes. This property ensures that the smallest element is always at the root.

To check if an array represents a min-heap:
- Start from the root (index 0).
- For each node at index `i`, compute the indices of the left child (`2*i + 1`) and right child (`2*i + 2`).
- Check if the node is less than or equal to its children. If any child exists and is smaller, the array does not represent a min-heap.

This is a standard approach used in heap operations and is efficient as it only requires a single pass through the array.

## Example Problems:

### 1. Check if a Binary Tree is a Min-Heap
**Problem**: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a min-heap.
**Solution**: Traverse the tree, and for each node, check if it is less than or equal to its children. If any node violates this, return false.
**Python3 Code**:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def is_min_heap(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    if not root:
        return True

    queue = [root]
    while queue:
        node = queue.pop(0)
        if node.left:
            if node.left.val < node.val:
                return False
            queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right:
            if node.right.val < node.val:
                return False
            queue.append(node.right)
    return True
```

### 2. Validate a Binary Heap
**Problem**: Given an array, check if it represents a valid binary heap (min or max).
**Solution**: For a min-heap, check that each node is less than or equal to its children. For a max-heap, check that each node is greater than or equal to its children.
**Python3 Code**:
```python
def is_heap(arr: List[int], is_min: bool = True) -> bool:
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        left = 2 * i + 1
        right = 2 * i + 2
        if left < n:
            if is_min and arr[left] < arr[i]:
                return False
            if not is_min and arr[left] > arr[i]:
                return False
        if right < n:
            if is_min and arr[right] < arr[i]:
                return False
            if not is_min and arr[right] > arr[i]:
                return False
    return True
```

### 3. Check if a Binary Tree is a Heap
**Problem**: Given a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree and a heap.
**Solution**: First, check if the tree is complete (all levels except possibly the last are completely filled and the last level is filled from left to right). Then check if it satisfies the heap property.
**Python3 Code**:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_complete(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    if not root:
        return True

    queue = deque([root])
    flag = False
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        if flag and (node.left or node.right):
            return False
        if not node.left and node.right:
            return False
        if node.left:
            queue.append(node.left)
        else:
            flag = True
        if node.right:
            queue.append(node.right)
        else:
            flag = True
    return True

def is_heap_tree(root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    return is_complete(root) and is_min_heap(root)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
To check if an array represents a min-heap, we need to verify that for every index `i`, the value at `arr[i]` is less than or equal to its left child (`arr[2*i + 1]`) and right child (`arr[2*i + 2]`). We iterate through the array and for each index, we check if the children exist and if they are greater than or equal to the parent.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def check_min_heap(arr: List[int]) -> bool:
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        left = 2 * i + 1
        right = 2 * i + 2
        if left < n and arr[left] < arr[i]:
            return False
        if right < n and arr[right] < arr[i]:
            return False
    return True

# Example usage:
# print(check_min_heap([1, 2, 3]))  # True
# print(check_min_heap([3, 2, 1]))  # False

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **type handling and comparison** in a heterogeneous list. The function must:
- Iterate through the list.
- Handle both `int` and `str` values.
- Convert `str` values to `int` if possible, or skip them if not.
- Find the minimum value among the valid integers.

This involves **type checking**, **type conversion**, and **comparison**.

---

## Tutorial:

In competitive programming, you often encounter heterogeneous data types in lists. For example, a list may contain both integers and strings. To process such a list, you need to:

1. **Check the type** of each element.
2. **Convert strings to integers** if they represent numbers (e.g., `"123"` ¡ú `123`).
3. **Skip non-convertible strings** (e.g., `"abc"`).
4. **Find the minimum value** among all valid integers.

This is a common scenario in problems involving parsing and filtering data.

---

## Example Problems:

### 1. **"Find the Minimum in a Mixed List" (Hypothetical Problem)**

**Problem Description**:  
You are given a list containing integers and strings. Some strings may represent integers (e.g., `"123"`), others may not (e.g., `"abc"`). Your task is to find the minimum integer value among the valid integers in the list.

**Solution**:  
- Iterate over each element in the list.
- For each element, check if it is an integer.
- If it's a string, try to convert it to an integer.
- If conversion fails, skip it.
- Track the minimum integer seen.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def min_val(listval):
    min_int = None
    for val in listval:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            current = val
        elif isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                current = int(val)
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            continue
        if min_int is None or current < min_int:
            min_int = current
    return min_int
```

---

### 2. **"Parsing and Filtering Data" (Hypothetical Problem)**

**Problem Description**:  
You are given a list of mixed data types. Your task is to extract all valid integers and find their minimum.

**Solution**:  
- Use `isinstance()` to check for integers.
- Use `try-except` to convert strings to integers.
- Track the minimum value.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def find_min_valid_int(data):
    min_val = None
    for item in data:
        if isinstance(item, int):
            num = item
        elif isinstance(item, str):
            try:
                num = int(item)
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            continue
        if min_val is None or num < min_val:
            min_val = num
    return min_val
```

---

### 3. **"Data Cleaning and Analysis" (Hypothetical Problem)**

**Problem Description**:  
You are given a list of values that may contain strings and integers. Clean the data by converting strings to integers where possible, and compute the minimum value.

**Solution**:  
- Clean the list by converting valid strings to integers.
- Find the minimum value.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def clean_and_find_min(data):
    cleaned = []
    for val in data:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            cleaned.append(val)
        elif isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                cleaned.append(int(val))
            except ValueError:
                pass
    return min(cleaned)
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- The function `min_val` takes a list of `str` and `int`.
- It iterates over each element.
- If it's an `int`, it uses it directly.
- If it's a `str`, it tries to convert it to an `int` using `int()`.
- If the conversion fails, it skips that element.
- It keeps track of the minimum value found.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List, Union

def min_val(listval: List[Union[str, int]]) -> int:
    min_int = None
    for val in listval:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            current = val
        elif isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                current = int(val)
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            continue
        if min_int is None or current < min_int:
            min_int = current
    return min_int
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **interleaving** elements from multiple lists. Since all three lists are of the same length, we can iterate through them in parallel, taking one element from each list at a time and appending them to the result list in sequence.

This is a **loop-based algorithm** that uses indexing to access elements from each list.

---

## Tutorial:

### What is Interleaving?

Interleaving refers to the process of combining elements from multiple sequences in a specific order. In this case, the order is to take one element from each of the three lists in sequence, repeating until all elements are used.

For example, if:

- `list1 = [1, 2, 3]`
- `list2 = [4, 5, 6]`
- `list3 = [7, 8, 9]`

Then the interleaved result would be:

`[1, 4, 7, 2, 5, 8, 3, 6, 9]`

### How to Implement it

We can use a `for` loop that iterates from `0` to `len(list1) - 1`, and at each step, we take the element at the current index from all three lists and add them to the result list.

This is a simple and efficient approach with a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the lists.

---

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 271. Encode and Decode Strings**
- **Problem Description**: This problem involves encoding and decoding a list of strings, which can be done using interleaving and other string manipulation techniques.
- **Solution**: While not exactly interleaving, it involves concatenating and separating strings in a specific way, similar to the logic used in interleaving lists.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  class Solution:
      def encode(self, strs: List[str]) -> str:
          return ''.join([s + chr(257) for s in strs])
      
      def decode(self, s: str) -> List[str]:
          return s.split(chr(257))[:-1]
  ```

### 2. **LeetCode 143. Reorder List**
- **Problem Description**: This problem requires reordering a linked list by interleaving the first and second halves of the list.
- **Solution**: This involves splitting the list, reversing the second half, and then interleaving the two halves.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  class Solution:
      def reorderList(self, head: ListNode) -> None:
          # Find middle of the list
          slow = fast = head
          while fast and fast.next:
              slow = slow.next
              fast = fast.next.next

          # Reverse second half
          prev, curr = None, slow
          while curr:
              next_node = curr.next
              curr.next = prev
              prev = curr
              curr = next_node

          # Interleave the first and reversed second half
          first, second = head, prev
          while second.next:
              next_first = first.next
              next_second = second.next
              first.next = second
              second.next = next_first
              first = next_first
              second = next_second
  ```

### 3. **Codeforces Round #662 (Div. 2) - Problem A: Rainbow Translation**
- **Problem Description**: This problem involves interleaving characters from two strings in a specific way.
- **Solution**: The solution uses a loop to take characters from each string alternately.
- **Code**:
  ```python
  def main():
      import sys
      input = sys.stdin.read
      s, t = input().split()
      res = []
      for i in range(len(s)):
          res.append(s[i])
          res.append(t[i])
      print(''.join(res))
  ```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We loop through each index from `0` to `len(list1) - 1`, and for each index, we add the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in order to the result list.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def interleave_lists(list1: List[int], list2: List[int], list3: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    for i in range(len(list1)):
        result.append(list1[i])
        result.append(list2[i])
        result.append(list3[i])
    return result

## Algorithms:

The core concept used in this problem is **string manipulation and iteration**. The goal is to find the length of the longest string in a list of strings. This involves:

- Iterating through each string in the list.
- Comparing the length of each string to a running maximum.
- Updating the maximum when a longer string is found.

This is a simple **linear scan** algorithm, which is efficient for this type of problem with a time complexity of **O(n)**, where n is the number of strings in the list.

---

## Tutorial:

### Understanding the Problem

The function `len_log(list1: List[str]) -> int` is supposed to return the length of the longest word (string) in a given list of strings.

### How to Solve It

1. **Initialize a variable** to keep track of the maximum length. You can start with 0.
2. **Iterate through each string** in the list.
3. **Compare the length** of the current string with the maximum length.
4. **Update the maximum** if the current string is longer.
5. **Return the maximum length** after the loop.

This is a straightforward approach that works efficiently even for large lists, as it only requires a single pass through the list.

---

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: **Longest Word in a Sentence**
**Problem Description:** Given a sentence (a string of words), find the length of the longest word.

**Solution:** Split the sentence into words, then apply the same logic as above.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def longest_word_length(sentence: str) -> int:
    words = sentence.split()
    max_length = 0
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > max_length:
            max_length = len(word)
    return max_length
```

---

### Problem 2: **Maximum Length of a String in a List**
**Problem Description:** Given a list of strings, find the length of the longest string.

**Solution:** Iterate through the list and keep track of the maximum length.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def max_string_length(list_of_strings: List[str]) -> int:
    max_len = 0
    for s in list_of_strings:
        if len(s) > max_len:
            max_len = len(s)
    return max_len
```

---

### Problem 3: **Longest Word in a Dictionary**
**Problem Description:** Given a dictionary of words, find the length of the longest word.

**Solution:** Iterate over the dictionary values (the words), and track the maximum length.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def longest_word_length_from_dict(word_dict: dict) -> int:
    max_len = 0
    for word in word_dict.values():
        if len(word) > max_len:
            max_len = len(word)
    return max_len
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `len_log` is supposed to return the length of the longest string in the list `list1`. We initialize a variable `max_len` to 0 and then iterate through each string in the list. If the length of the current string is greater than `max_len`, we update `max_len`. Finally, we return `max_len`.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def len_log(list1: List[str]) -> int:
    """
    Write a python function to find the length of the longest word.
    """
    max_len = 0
    for word in list1:

            max_len = len(word)
    return max_len

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):

The core concept in this problem is a **simple conditional check**. The function needs to determine whether there is a loss, which is when the actual cost is greater than the sale amount. If there is a loss, the function returns the difference between the actual cost and the sale amount. Otherwise, it returns 0.

This problem involves basic **arithmetic operations** and **conditional logic**.

---

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, many problems involve checking conditions and performing basic arithmetic. This problem is a good example of how to implement a simple logic check and return the correct result based on it.

The steps to solve this problem are:

1. **Compare the actual cost and sale amount**:
   - If `actual_cost > sale_amount`, then there is a loss.
   - Otherwise, there is no loss.

2. **Calculate the loss**:
   - If there is a loss, subtract the sale amount from the actual cost to get the loss amount.
   - If not, return 0.

This is a straightforward implementation that can be done in one line using a conditional expression.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Check if a Number is Positive, Negative, or Zero**
**Description:** Write a function that takes an integer as input and returns "Positive", "Negative", or "Zero" based on the value.

**Solution:** Use conditional checks to determine the sign of the number.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def check_number(n: int) -> str:
    if n > 0:

**Solution:** Check if the purchase amount is greater than 1000. If so, apply 10% discount, otherwise return the original amount.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def calculate_discount(amount: int) -> int:
    if amount > 1000:
        return amount - (amount * 10 // 100)
    else:
        return amount
```

### 3. **Problem: Check Even or Odd**
**Description:** Write a function that takes an integer and returns "Even" if the number is even, otherwise "Odd".

**Solution:** Use the modulus operator to check if the number is divisible by 2.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def check_even_odd(n: int) -> str:
    return "Even" if n % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `loss_amount` checks if the `actual_cost` is greater than the `sale_amount`. If it is, it returns the difference (loss), otherwise it returns 0. This is a simple conditional check with arithmetic subtraction.

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **array traversal** and **summation**. It involves iterating through the elements of a list and adding them up to compute the total sum. This is a fundamental operation in programming and is often used as a building block for more complex algorithms.

## Tutorial:
Summing the elements of an array is one of the simplest and most common operations in programming. The algorithm works by initializing a variable to store the sum (often starting at 0), then looping through each element in the array and adding it to the sum variable.

This operation has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where n is the number of elements in the array. It is efficient and straightforward, making it ideal for beginner problems and as a base for more complex operations like computing averages, finding maximums, etc.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Sum of Array Elements**
- **Description**: Given a list of integers, find the sum of all elements.
- **Solution**: Iterate through the list and add each element to a running total.
- **Python3 Code**:
```python
def array_sum(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        total += num
    return total

# Example usage:
print(array_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 15
```

### 2. **Problem: Find the Average of Array Elements**
- **Description**: Given a list of integers, compute the average.
- **Solution**: First, compute the sum of the array, then divide by the number of elements.
- **Python3 Code**:
```python
def array_average(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    total = sum(arr)
    return total / len(arr)

# Example usage:
print(array_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 3.0
```

### 3. **Problem: Sum of Even Elements in Array**
- **Description**: Given a list of integers, compute the sum of all even numbers.
- **Solution**: Loop through the array, check if each element is even, and add it to the total if it is.
- **Python3 Code**:
```python
def sum_even(arr):
    total = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 == 0:
            total += num
    return total

# Example usage:
print(sum_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Output: 6
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `_sum` is intended to compute the sum of all elements in a given list of integers. The solution involves iterating through the list and adding each element to a total sum, which is initialized to 0.

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **iterating through a list of lists** to find the one with the **maximum length**. The algorithm involves:
1. Iterating through each sublist in the input list.
2. Comparing the lengths of the sublists.
3. Keeping track of the maximum length and the corresponding sublist.

This is a straightforward **linear scan** algorithm, which is efficient for this kind of problem.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, when you are given a list of lists or similar structures, the common approach is to iterate through the elements and apply a specific condition or computation. In this case, we are interested in the **length of each sublist**.

To solve this problem:
- Initialize a variable to store the maximum length and the corresponding list.
- Loop through each sublist in the input.
- For each sublist, check if its length is greater than the current maximum length.
- If yes, update the maximum length and store the sublist.
- Finally, return the sublist with the maximum length along with its length.

This approach is **O(n)** in time complexity, where n is the number of sublists, and it is efficient for most practical purposes.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Find the Longest Word in a Sentence (LeetCode 58)**
- **Problem**: Given a string `s` representing a sentence, return the length of the longest word in the sentence.
- **Solution**: Split the sentence into words, and find the word with the maximum length.
- **Code**:
```python
def length_of_longest_word(s: str) -> int:
    words = s.split()
    return max(len(word) for word in words)
```

### 2. **Find the Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode 3)**
- **Problem**: Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.
- **Solution**: Use a sliding window approach to keep track of the current substring and its length.
- **Code**:
```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_set = set()
    left = 0
    max_len = 0

            left += 1

        max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
    return max_len
```

### 3. **Longest Consecutive Sequence (LeetCode 128)**
- **Problem**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence.
- **Solution**: Use a set to store the numbers and then for each number, check if it is the start of a sequence, and then count the length of the sequence.
- **Code**:
```python
def longest_consecutive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    num_set = set(nums)
    longest = 0
    for num in num_set:
        if num - 1 not in num_set:
            current_num = num
            current_streak = 1
            while current_num + 1 in num_set:
                current_num += 1
                current_streak += 1
            longest = max(longest, current_streak)
    return longest
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `max_length_list` takes a list of lists as input. It iterates through each sublist and keeps track of the one with the maximum length. It returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the list itself.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:
```python

            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
    return (max_len, max_list)

## Algorithms:

The core concept of the problem is **tuple manipulation** and **list comprehension**. The task is to extract the last element (rear element) from each tuple in a list of tuples. This is a basic data structure operation, often used in competitive programming and data processing.

## Tutorial:

In Python, tuples are immutable sequences of elements. To access the last element of a tuple, you can use indexing: `tuple[-1]` or `tuple[len(tuple) - 1]`. The problem requires iterating through a list of tuples and collecting the last element of each tuple into a new list.

This is a straightforward operation that can be efficiently performed using **list comprehension**, which is a concise way to create lists in Python.

For example, given the list:

```python
test_list = [(1, "a", 3), (4, "b", 6), (7, "c", 9)]
```

The expected output would be:

```python
[3, 6, 9]
```

def runningSum(nums):
    result = []

- **Solution**: Find the maximum value in the array, then check for each element if it plus `extraCandies` is greater than or equal to the maximum.
- **Python3 Code**:

def kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies):
    max_candies = max(candies)

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept for this problem is **combinatorics**, specifically the idea of counting total possible pairs and subtracting the number of pairs with equal elements. The steps are:

1. **Total pairs**: The number of unordered pairs in an array of size `n` is given by the formula `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
2. **Equal pairs**: For each unique number, calculate how many pairs can be formed within its occurrences using `count * (count - 1) // 2`.
3. **Result**: Subtract the number of equal pairs from the total pairs to get the number of pairs with unequal elements.

This problem is a classic example of using **combinatorial counting** and **frequency counting**.

---

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, counting pairs with specific conditions is a common task. The key idea is to compute the total number of possible pairs and then subtract those that do **not** meet the condition.

For example, in this problem, we want to count **unordered pairs (i, j)** where `i < j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]`.

### Steps:
1. Compute the total number of unordered pairs:  
   `total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2`
2. Count the frequency of each number in the array.
3. For each number with frequency `f`, compute the number of **equal pairs** it contributes:  
   `equal_pairs += f * (f - 1) // 2`
4. Subtract the equal pairs from the total to get the desired count.

This approach is efficient and runs in **O(n)** time, assuming we use a dictionary or `collections.Counter` to count frequencies.

---

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Count Pairs with Equal Values (LeetCode 1837)
**Problem Statement**: Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] + nums[j] == k`.

**Solution**:
- Use a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each number.
- For each number, check if `k - num` exists in the dictionary.
- Be careful to avoid double-counting and handle the case where `num == k - num`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
from collections import Counter

def countPairs(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    freq = Counter()
    for num in nums:
        count += freq[k - num]
        freq[num] += 1
    return count
```

### Problem 2: Count of Pairs with Equal Values (LeetCode 2006)
**Problem Statement**: Given an array `nums` of length `n`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`.

**Solution**:
- Use a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each number.
- For each number with frequency `f`, the number of equal pairs is `f * (f - 1) // 2`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
from collections import Counter

def numIdenticalPairs(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    freq = Counter(nums)
    return sum(f * (f - 1) // 2 for f in freq.values())
```

---

### Problem 3: Number of Unequal Pairs (Codeforces 1462B)
**Problem Statement**: Given an array of integers, count the number of unordered pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `arr[i] != arr[j]`.

**Solution**:
- Total pairs = `n * (n - 1) // 2`
- Equal pairs = sum of `f * (f - 1) // 2` for each frequency `f`
- Result = total pairs - equal pairs

**Python3 Code**:
```python
from collections import Counter

def countUnequalPairs(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    freq = Counter(nums)
    equal_pairs = sum(f * (f - 1) // 2 for f in freq.values())
    return total_pairs - equal_pairs
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- The total number of unordered pairs in the array is `n * (n - 1) // 2`.
- Count the frequency of each element in the array.
- For each frequency `f`, compute the number of pairs where both elements are the same using `f * (f - 1) // 2`.
- Subtract the number of equal pairs from the total to get the number of pairs with unequal elements.

### Python3 code:
```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def count_Pairs(arr: List[int], n: int) -> int:
    total_pairs = n * (n - 1) // 2
    freq = Counter(arr)

    return total_pairs - equal_pairs

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The core concept in this problem is **handling bidirectional relationships in a list of tuples**. Specifically, we are to count how many pairs (u, v) exist in the list such that both (u, v) and (v, u) are present.

This involves:
- **Set operations** for efficient lookups.
- **Hashing** to quickly check for the existence of reverse pairs.
- **Iterating through the list** and checking for the reverse pair.

## Tutorial:

In competitive programming, handling bidirectional relationships is a common problem. For example, in graph theory, edges can be directed or undirected. If an edge (u, v) is present, and the reverse (v, u) is also present, it's considered a bidirectional or undirected edge.

To solve such a problem:
1. Use a set to store all tuples for quick lookup.
2. Iterate through each tuple in the list.
3. For each tuple (u, v), check if (v, u) exists in the set.
4. If it exists and we haven't counted it yet, increment the count.

To avoid counting the same pair twice (e.g., (u, v) and (v, u) both being counted), we can mark pairs as visited or use a visited set.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 1202. Smallest String With Swaps**
- **Problem**: You are given a string and a list of pairs of indices. You can swap characters at those indices. Find the lexicographically smallest string possible.
- **Solution**: Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to group indices that can be swapped. Then, sort characters in each group and assign them back to the string.
- **Code**:
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            self.parent[rootY] = rootX

def smallestStringWithSwaps(s: str, pairs: List[List[int]]) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    for u, v in pairs:
        uf.union(u, v)
    
    groups = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n):
        root = uf.find(i)
        groups[root].append(i)
    
    res = list(s)
    for group in groups.values():
        indices = sorted(group)
        chars = sorted([s[i] for i in indices])
        for i, idx in enumerate(indices):
            res[idx] = chars[i]
    
    return ''.join(res)
```

- **Solution**: Use sets to find the common elements.

    return list(set(nums1) & set(nums2))
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:

We are given a list of tuples, and we need to count how many of them have a reverse pair in the list. For example, if (1, 2) exists, and (2, 1) also exists, that counts as one bidirectional pair.

To solve this:
- We store all the tuples in a set for O(1) lookups.
- We iterate through the list and for each (u, v), check if (v, u) is in the set.
- We also avoid double-counting by checking if (u, v) has already been counted.

### Python3 code:

```python
def count_bidirectional(test_list: List[Tuple[int, int]]) -> int:
    seen = set()
    count = 0
    for u, v in test_list:
        if (v, u) in seen:
            count += 1
        seen.add((u, v))
    return count
```

### Example:

```python
print(count_bidirectional([(1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 4), (4, 3), (5, 6)]))  # Output: 2
```

In this example, (1, 2) and (2, 1) form a bidirectional pair, and (3, 4) and (4, 3) form another. So the output is 2.

## Algorithms:
The core concept used in solving this problem is **string parsing with stack or index tracking**. The problem requires identifying the start and end of parentheses and removing the content inside them. This can be done using a stack to track the indices of opening parentheses and then removing the substring between the opening and closing parentheses.

## Tutorial:
To solve the problem of removing parentheses and their contents, we can follow this approach:

1. **Track the positions of the opening parentheses** using a stack.
2. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, pop the last opening parenthesis from the stack.
3. For each pair of opening and closing parentheses, we can mark the indices to be removed.
4. After processing the entire string, we build a new string by skipping the indices that fall within any of the removed ranges.

This approach is efficient and can handle nested parentheses as well, as long as they are properly matched.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Remove Invalid Parentheses (LeetCode 301)**  
**Problem Description:**  
Given a string `s` containing parentheses and other characters, return all possible valid parentheses strings that can be formed by removing some characters.

**Solution:**  
This problem uses a **backtracking** approach to try all possible removals and check for valid parentheses. However, it also uses **stacks** to validate the parentheses during the process.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
from typing import List
from collections import deque

def removeInvalidParentheses(s: str) -> List[str]:
    def is_valid(s):
        count = 0
        for ch in s:
            if ch == '(':
                count += 1
            elif ch == ')':
                count -= 1
                if count < 0:
                    return False
        return count == 0

    result = []
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([s])
    found = False

    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        if current in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current)
        if is_valid(current):
            result.append(current)
            found = True
        if not found:
            for i in range(len(current)):
                if current[i] in '()':
                    new_s = current[:i] + current[i+1:]
                    if new_s not in visited:
                        queue.append(new_s)
    return result
```

### 2. **Problem: Minimum Number of Moves to Make Parentheses Valid (LeetCode 1111)**  
**Problem Description:**  
Given a string of parentheses, find the minimum number of moves required to make it valid.

**Solution:**  
This problem uses a **stack** to track unmatched parentheses. We count the number of unmatched opening and closing parentheses and compute the minimum moves needed.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def minAddToMakeValid(s: str) -> int:
    left = 0
    right = 0
    for ch in s:
        if ch == '(':
            left += 1
        elif ch == ')':
            if left > 0:
                left -= 1
            else:
                right += 1
    return left + right
```

---

### 3. **Problem: Longest Valid Parentheses (LeetCode 32)**  
**Problem Description:**  
Find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring in a given string.

**Solution:**  
This problem can be solved using a **stack** or a **dynamic programming** approach. The stack approach tracks the indices of unmatched parentheses and computes the length of valid substrings.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:
    stack = [-1]
    max_len = 0
    for i, ch in enumerate(s):
        if ch == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - stack[-1])
    return max_len
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The goal is to remove all characters between the first unmatched opening parenthesis `(` and its corresponding closing parenthesis `)`. We can achieve this using a **stack** to track the indices of the opening parentheses. When we encounter a closing parenthesis, we pop the last opening index from the stack. If the stack is not empty after popping, we know that the current closing parenthesis has a matching opening parenthesis. Otherwise, we have an unmatched closing parenthesis.

We then build the result string by skipping the characters between the indices of the matched parentheses.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def remove_parenthesis(items: List[str]) -> str:
    result = []
    stack = []
    for item in items:
        for ch in item:
            if ch == '(':
                stack.append(len(result))
            elif ch == ')':
                if stack:
                    start = stack.pop()
                    # Remove the characters from start to current index
                    result[start:] = []
            else:
                result.append(ch)
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Example:
```python
print(remove_parenthesis(["abc(def)ghi"]))  # Output: "abcghi"
print(remove_parenthesis(["(a(b)c)"]))     # Output: ""
print(remove_parenthesis(["a(b)c(d)e"]))   # Output: "a c e"
```

This function handles multiple strings and removes all characters between matched parentheses, including nested ones.

P(0) = 3
P(1) = 0
P(2) = 2
P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) for n > 2
```

To compute the sum of the first `n` Perrin numbers, we can use an iterative approach:
1. Initialize the first three terms of the sequence.
2. Use a loop to compute subsequent terms based on the recurrence relation.
3. Accumulate the sum as we go.

This method is efficient and works in O(n) time with O(1) space, making it suitable for large values of `n`.

## Example Problems:

### 1. Fibonacci Sum
**Problem:** Compute the sum of the first `n` Fibonacci numbers.

**Solution:** Use an iterative approach to compute each Fibonacci number and sum them up.

**Python Code:**
```python
def fib_sum(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    a, b = 0, 1
    total = a + b
    for _ in range(2, n):
        a, b = b, a + b
        total += b
    return total
```

### 2. Tribonacci Sequence
**Problem:** Compute the sum of the first `n` Tribonacci numbers.

**Solution:** Tribonacci numbers are defined by the recurrence relation `T(n) = T(n-1) + T(n-2) + T(n-3)`. Use a similar iterative approach to compute and sum them.

**Python Code:**
```python
def trib_sum(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    a, b, c = 0, 0, 1
    total = a + b + c
    for _ in range(3, n):
        a, b, c = b, c, a + b + c
        total += c
    return total
```

### 3. Padovan Sequence
**Problem:** Compute the sum of the first `n` Padovan numbers.

**Solution:** Padovan sequence is defined by `P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)` with initial values `P(0) = 1`, `P(1) = 1`, `P(2) = 1`. Use an iterative approach to calculate and sum.

**Python Code:**
```python
def padovan_sum(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    a, b, c = 1, 1, 1
    total = a + b + c
    for _ in range(3, n):
        a, b, c = b, c, a + b
        total += c
    return total
```

        total += p3
        p0, p1, p2 = p1, p2, p3

## Algorithms:
The core concept for solving the problem of counting the number of divisors of a given integer is **prime factorization**. The number of divisors of a number can be determined by:

1. **Prime factorization** of the number: Express the number as a product of its prime factors, e.g., $ n = p_1^{e1} \times p_2^{e2} \times \dots \times p_k^{ek} $.
2. **Divisor counting formula**: The total number of divisors of $ n $ is $ (e1 + 1) \times (e2 + 1) \times \dots \times (ek + 1) $.

To implement this, we need to:
- Factorize the number into its prime factors.
- Count the exponents of each prime factor.
- Multiply the (exponent + 1) of each prime factor to get the total number of divisors.

## Tutorial:
To find the number of divisors of a given number $ n $:

### Step 1: Prime Factorization
We need to find all the prime factors of $ n $ and their corresponding exponents. For example, if $ n = 12 $, the prime factorization is $ 2^2 \times 3^1 $.

### Step 2: Apply Divisor Counting Formula
Once we have the prime factorization, the number of divisors is the product of $ (e_i + 1) $ for each prime factor $ p_i $ with exponent $ e_i $.

For $ n = 12 $, the number of divisors is $ (2 + 1) \times (1 + 1) = 3 \times 2 = 6 $, which are $ 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12 $.

### Step 3: Efficient Implementation
To factorize $ n $ efficiently:
- Check divisibility from 2 up to $ \sqrt{n} $.
- For each divisor, divide $ n $ as many times as possible and count the exponent.
- If $ n $ is still greater than 1 after the loop, it means $ n $ itself is a prime number and should be included as a factor.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Count the number of divisors of a number
**Problem Description**: Given an integer $ n $, count the number of its divisors.

**Solution**:
Use prime factorization to determine the number of divisors.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def divisor(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    count = 1
    i = 2
    while i * i <= n:
        exponent = 0
        while n % i == 0:
            n //= i
            exponent += 1
        if exponent > 0:
            count *= (exponent + 1)
        i += 1
    if n > 1:
        count *= 2
    return count
```

    factors = generate_factors(k)

- For each number, compute the number of divisors.
- Track the maximum.

        if div_count > max_div:
            max_div = div_count
            max_num = num
    return max_num
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `divisor(n)` calculates the number of divisors of a given integer `n` using prime factorization. It iterates through possible divisors from 2 up to the square root of `n`. For each divisor, it divides `n` as long as it is divisible, counting the exponent. After that, if `n` is still greater than 1, it means `n` is a prime number itself and should be counted as a factor. The number of divisors is then computed as the product of (exponent + 1) for each prime factor.

### Python3 code:
```python
def divisor(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Write a Python function to find the number of divisors of a given integer.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept used to solve the problem of counting inversions in an array is **Merge Sort**. This is because the merge sort algorithm allows us to count the number of inversions while sorting the array. An inversion is a pair of indices (i, j) such that i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. The merge sort approach is efficient with a time complexity of O(n log n).

## Tutorial:
An inversion in an array is a pair of elements where the order is reversed. For example, in the array [2, 4, 1], the pair (2, 1) and (4, 1) are inversions. The goal is to count all such pairs.

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm that works by recursively splitting the array into halves, sorting them, and then merging them back together. During the merge step, we can count inversions because when we move an element from the right subarray to the merged array, we know that all the elements remaining in the left subarray are greater than the current element from the right subarray, hence they form inversions.

The steps are:
1. Split the array into two halves.
2. Recursively count inversions in each half.
3. Merge the two halves and count inversions that occur during the merge.
4. Return the total number of inversions.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Count Inversions in an Array**
**Problem:** Given an array, count the number of inversions in it.
**Solution:** Use a modified merge sort to count inversions while sorting.
**Code:**
```python
def merge_sort(arr, temp, left, right):
    if left >= right:
        return 0
    mid = (left + right) // 2
    inv_count = 0
    inv_count += merge_sort(arr, temp, left, mid)
    inv_count += merge_sort(arr, temp, mid + 1, right)
    inv_count += merge(arr, temp, left, mid, right)
    return inv_count

def merge(arr, temp, left, mid, right):
    i = left
    j = mid + 1
    k = left
    inv_count = 0
    while i <= mid and j <= right:
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            temp[k] = arr[i]
            i += 1
        else:
            temp[k] = arr[j]
            inv_count += (mid - i + 1)
            j += 1
        k += 1
    while i <= mid:
        temp[k] = arr[i]
        i += 1
        k += 1
    while j <= right:
        temp[k] = arr[j]
        j += 1
        k += 1
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        arr[i] = temp[i]
    return inv_count

def count_inversions(arr):
    temp = [0] * len(arr)
    return merge_sort(arr, temp, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### 2. **Inversion Count in a Permutation**
**Problem:** Given a permutation of numbers from 1 to n, count the number of inversions.
**Solution:** Same as the previous example, but the array is guaranteed to be a permutation.
**Code:**
```python
def count_inversions_permutation(arr):
    temp = [0] * len(arr)
    return merge_sort(arr, temp, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

### 3. **K-th Smallest Element with Inversions**
**Problem:** Given an array, find the k-th smallest element using inversion count.
**Solution:** Use a modified merge sort to count inversions and then find the k-th smallest element using a binary search approach.
**Code:**
```python
def kth_smallest_with_inversions(arr, k):
    # This is a more complex problem, and the code is not provided here
    # for brevity, but the approach involves using inversion count during sorting
    pass
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We will implement a modified version of the merge sort algorithm to count inversions. The function `get_Inv_Count` will take an array and return the number of inversions. The algorithm splits the array recursively, sorts it, and counts the inversions during the merge step.

### Python3 code to solve the original problem:
```python

def get_Inv_Count(arr: List[int]) -> int:
    def merge_sort(arr, temp, left, right):

        mid = (left + right) // 2
        inv_count = 0
        inv_count += merge_sort(arr, temp, left, mid)
        inv_count += merge_sort(arr, temp, mid + 1, right)
        inv_count += merge(arr, temp, left, mid, right)
        return inv_count

    def merge(arr, temp, left, mid, right):
        i = left
        j = mid + 1
        k = left
        inv_count = 0

                temp[k] = arr[i]

            else:

## Algorithms:
The core concept for this problem involves **sorting the digits in descending order** to form the largest possible number. However, we also need to handle the case where all digits are zero, to avoid returning "0000" instead of "0".

## Tutorial:
To find the largest number that can be formed from a list of digits, the most straightforward approach is to sort the digits in **descending order** and then concatenate them. For example, if the input is `[3, 6, 8, 1]`, sorting in descending order gives `[8, 6, 3, 1]`, and the result is `8631`.

However, if the list contains only zeros, like `[0, 0, 0]`, we should return `"0"` instead of `"000"`.

The steps are:
1. Sort the digits in descending order.
2. Join them into a string.
3. If the result is all zeros, return `"0"`.
4. Otherwise, return the string.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Largest Number (LeetCode 179)**
**Problem:** Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.

**Solution:** The key is to compare the numbers in a custom way. For example, for `a` and `b`, compare `a + b` vs `b + a`. If `a + b > b + a`, then `a` should come before `b`.

**Python Code:**
```python
from typing import List
from functools import cmp_to_key

def largest_number(nums: List[int]) -> str:
    def compare(a: str, b: str) -> int:
        if a + b > b + a:
            return -1
        elif a + b < b + a:
            return 1
        else:
            return 0

    nums = list(map(str, nums))
    nums.sort(key=cmp_to_key(compare))
    result = ''.join(nums)
    return result if result[0] != '0' else '0'
```

---

### 2. **Form Largest Number from Digits (Codeforces or similar)**
**Problem:** Given a list of digits, form the largest number possible.

**Solution:** Sort the digits in descending order and concatenate them. If all digits are zero, return `"0"`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def form_largest_number(digits: List[int]) -> str:
    digits.sort(reverse=True)
    result = ''.join(map(str, digits))
    return result if result[0] != '0' else '0'
```

---

### 3. **Largest Possible Number (HackerRank)**
**Problem:** Given a list of digits, return the largest number that can be formed.

**Solution:** Similar to the previous example, sort digits in descending order and join them. Handle the all-zero case.

**Python Code:**
```python
def largest_possible_number(digits: List[int]) -> str:
    digits.sort(reverse=True)
    num_str = ''.join(map(str, digits))
    return num_str if num_str[0] != '0' else '0'
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- Sort the input list of integers in descending order.
- Join them into a string.
- If the result starts with '0', return '0' (to handle the case where all digits are zero).
- Otherwise, return the string.

def find_Max_Num(arr: List[int]) -> int:

The core concept in this problem is **iterating through a nested list structure** and **summing all the elements**. This involves:

- **Nested loops**: To access elements in a list of lists.
- **Accumulation**: To keep a running total of the sum.

This is a basic but essential concept in programming, especially in competitive programming where data is often structured in complex ways.

---

## Tutorial:

To compute the cumulative sum of all values in a list of lists, you can follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable to store the total sum (e.g., `total = 0`).
2. Loop through each sublist in the main list.
3. For each sublist, loop through its elements.
4. Add each element to the `total`.
5. Return the `total`.

This is a common pattern in programming and is often used in problems that involve 2D arrays or matrices. The time complexity is **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the number of sublists and `m` is the average number of elements per sublist.

## Algorithms:
The core concept used in this problem is **element-wise operations** on a list. Specifically, the function requires computing the **n-th power** of each number in the list. This is a straightforward application of **list comprehension** or **looping through the list** and applying a mathematical operation to each element.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, it's common to process lists of numbers by applying mathematical operations to each element. For example, squaring each number, cubing it, or raising it to a given power `n`. This is often done using **list comprehensions** in Python for efficiency and readability.

The general approach is:
1. Iterate through each number in the input list.
2. For each number, compute the n-th power.
3. Collect all the results in a new list and return it.

This is a basic but essential skill in many programming problems involving mathematical transformations of data.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Square Each Number in List**
**Problem:** Given a list of integers, return a list where each number is squared.

**Solution:** Use list comprehension to square each number in the list.

```python
def square_nums(nums):
    return [x ** 2 for x in nums]
```

### 2. **Cube Each Number in List**
**Problem:** Given a list of integers, return a list where each number is cubed.

**Solution:** Use list comprehension to cube each number.

```python
def cube_nums(nums):
    return [x ** 3 for x in nums]
```

### 3. **Raise Each Number to the Power of n**
**Problem:** Given a list of integers and a number `n`, return a list where each number is raised to the power of `n`.

**Solution:** Use list comprehension to compute `x ** n` for each `x` in the list.

```python
def power_nums(nums, n):
    return [x ** n for x in nums]
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `nth_nums` takes a list of integers `nums` and an integer `n`. It returns a new list where each element is the n-th power of the corresponding element in the input list. This can be efficiently done using list comprehension in Python.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The core concept in this problem is **bitwise operations**, specifically **left rotation** of bits in a 32-bit number. A left rotation shifts the bits of a number to the left by a certain number of positions, and the bits that fall off the left end are reinserted at the right end.

Key operations involved:
- Bitwise AND (`&`) to mask the number to 32 bits.
- Bitwise OR (`|`) to combine the rotated parts.
- Bitwise shift (`<<`, `>>`) to move the bits.

## Tutorial:

A left rotation of `d` bits for a 32-bit number `n` can be done as follows:

1. **Shift the number left by `d` bits**: `n << d`
2. **Shift the number right by `32 - d` bits**: `n >> (32 - d)`
3. **Combine the two parts using OR**: `(n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))`

However, since Python uses arbitrary-precision integers, we need to **mask** the result to ensure it's treated as a 32-bit number. This is done using `& 0xFFFFFFFF`, which keeps only the last 32 bits.

Example:
If `n = 0b10110011` (8-bit for simplicity), and `d = 2`, then:
- `n << 2 = 0b11001100`
- `n >> 6 = 0b00000010`
- Result = `0b11001100 | 0b00000010 = 0b11001110`

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Left Rotate String
**Description**: Given a string and an integer `d`, rotate the string left by `d` positions.

**Solution**: Use string slicing:
```python
def left_rotate_string(s: str, d: int) -> str:
    return s[d:] + s[:d]
```

### Problem 2: Rotate Image
**Description**: Rotate a 2D matrix by 90 degrees clockwise.

**Solution**: Use transpose and reverse rows:
```python
def rotate_image(matrix: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    n = len(matrix)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    for row in matrix:
        row.reverse()
```

### Problem 3: Rotate Array
**Description**: Rotate an array to the right by `d` steps.

**Solution**: Use slicing:
```python
def rotate_array(nums: List[int], d: int) -> None:
    d %= len(nums)
    nums[:] = nums[-d:] + nums[:-d]
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
To left rotate a 32-bit integer `n` by `d` bits:
- We shift `n` left by `d` bits.
- We shift `n` right by `32 - d` bits.
- Combine the two parts using OR.
- Mask the result with `0xFFFFFFFF` to ensure it is treated as a 32-bit number.

### Python3 code:
```python
def left_rotate(n: int, d: int) -> int:
    """
    Rotate left bits of a 32-bit number by d positions.
    """
    d %= 32  # Ensure d is within 0-31
    return ((n << d) | (n >> (32 - d))) & 0xFFFFFFFF

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The core concepts involved in this problem are:
- Bitwise operations (specifically, bit manipulation using `&`, `|`, `^`, and bit shifting).
- Identifying the position of the first and last bit of a number.
- Using a mask to toggle specific bits in a number.

The key idea is to create a mask that has `1`s in all positions except the first and last bit, and then apply the XOR operation with the original number to toggle those bits.

## Tutorial:

In binary representation, the first bit (most significant bit) and the last bit (least significant bit) of a number are usually the leftmost and rightmost bits, respectively. The task is to toggle (i.e., flip from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0) all the bits **except** the first and last.

To do this:
1. Find the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. This can be done using `n.bit_length()`.
2. Create a mask that has `1`s in all bit positions except the first and last.
   - For example, if `n` is 15 (binary `1111`), then the mask would be `0110` (binary), which is `6` in decimal.
3. Apply the XOR operation between `n` and the mask to toggle the middle bits.

To generate the mask:
- Start with a number that has all bits set to 1 for the number of bits in `n`.
- Then, clear the first and last bits using bitwise AND with a mask that has `0`s in those positions.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Toggle All Bits Except First and Last (Same as the original problem)**

**Problem Description:**  
Given an integer `n`, toggle all the bits except the first and last bit.

**Solution:**  
Use the method described above: create a mask that has 1s in all positions except the first and last, and then apply XOR with `n`.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    bit_length = n.bit_length()
    mask = (1 << bit_length) - 1  # All bits set to 1
    mask ^= (1 << (bit_length - 1))  # Clear the first bit
    mask ^= 1  # Clear the last bit
    return n ^ mask
```

---

### 2. **Check if a Number is a Power of Two (Bitwise)**

**Problem Description:**  
Check if a given number is a power of two.

**Solution:**  
A number `n` is a power of two if it has exactly one bit set in its binary representation. This can be checked using the property: `n & (n - 1) == 0`.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def is_power_of_two(n: int) -> bool:
    return n != 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
```

---

### 3. **Count the Number of Set Bits (Hamming Weight)**

**Problem Description:**  
Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of a given number.

**Solution:**  
Use a loop to count the set bits by checking each bit using `&` and shifting.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def count_set_bits(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    while n:
        count += n & 1
        n >>= 1
    return count
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:

The function `toggle_middle_bits` works as follows:
1. If the number is 0, return 0.
2. Determine the number of bits in `n` using `n.bit_length()`.
3. Create a mask that has all bits set to 1 for the length of `n`.
4. Clear the first bit by XOR-ing the mask with `1 << (bit_length - 1)`.
5. Clear the last bit by XOR-ing the mask with `1`.
6. Apply XOR between `n` and the mask to toggle the middle bits.

### Python3 code:
```python
def toggle_middle_bits(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    bit_length = n.bit_length()
    mask = (1 << bit_length) - 1  # All bits set to 1
    mask ^= (1 << (bit_length - 1))  # Clear the first bit
    mask ^= 1  # Clear the last bit
    return n ^ mask
```

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **string manipulation** and **list iteration**. Specifically, we need to convert a list of strings into a single string by concatenating all the elements.

This problem involves a simple loop or using built-in functions like `join()` to combine the elements of a list into a string.

## Tutorial:
In Python, converting a list of strings into a single string is a common task. The most efficient and clean way to do this is by using the `join()` method. The `join()` method takes an iterable (like a list) and joins the elements into a single string, with a specified separator between them.

For example:
```python
my_list = ["Hello", "World"]
result = " ".join(my_list)  # "Hello World"
```

If you want to concatenate the elements without any separator, you can use an empty string as the separator:
```python
result = "".join(my_list)  # "HelloWorld"
```

This method is efficient and readable, and is the preferred way to convert a list of strings into a single string.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Concatenate Strings**
**Description**: Given a list of strings, concatenate them into a single string.

**Solution**: Use the `join()` method to combine the list elements into a single string.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def concatenate_strings(strings: List[str]) -> str:
    return "".join(strings)
```

---

### 2. **Problem: Convert List of Words to Sentence**
**Description**: Given a list of words, convert them into a sentence with spaces between the words.

**Solution**: Use the `join()` method with a space as the separator.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def list_to_sentence(words: List[str]) -> str:
    return " ".join(words)
```

---

### 3. **Problem: Join with Custom Separator**
**Description**: Given a list of strings and a separator, join the strings using the separator.

**Solution**: Use the `join()` method with the given separator.

def join_with_separator(strings: List[str], sep: str) -> str:
    return sep.join(strings)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

The core concept in this problem is **iteration over a list of lists** and **accessing elements by index**. The function needs to loop through each sublist in the given list and extract the first element (index `0`) of each, then collect them into a new list.

This is a basic list manipulation task and involves simple loops and list comprehensions.

---

## Tutorial:
In Python, a list of lists is a common data structure used in many programming problems. For instance, you might have a list like `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]` and want to extract specific elements from each sublist.

To extract the first element of each sublist:
- You can use a **for loop** to iterate over each sublist.
- Use `sublist[0]` to get the first element of each sublist.
- Append this element to a new list.

Alternatively, you can use **list comprehension** for a more concise and Pythonic solution. The syntax would be:
```python
result = [sub[0] for sub in lst]
```

This is efficient and readable, making it ideal for competitive programming where code clarity and performance matter.

## Algorithms:

The core concept involved in this problem is **basic mathematical conversion**, specifically converting degrees to radians. This is done using the formula:

$$
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
$$

This is a simple mathematical operation that is often used in geometry, trigonometry, and computer graphics.

## Tutorial:

To convert degrees to radians, you use the mathematical constant ¦Ð (pi), which is approximately 3.14159. The formula is straightforward:

$$
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
$$

In Python, you can use the `math.pi` constant from the `math` module to get the value of ¦Ð. This allows you to perform the conversion accurately.

The `radian_degree` function takes an integer `degree` as input and returns the corresponding value in radians as a float.

## Example Problems:

### 1. Problem: Convert Radians to Degrees
**Problem Description:**  
You are given a number in radians, and you need to convert it to degrees.

**Solution:**  
Use the formula:  
$$
\text{degrees} = \text{radians} \times \left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)
$$

**Python3 Code:**
```python
import math

def radian_to_degree(radian: float) -> float:
    return radian * (180 / math.pi)

# Example usage:
print(radian_to_degree(math.pi))  # Output: 180.0
```

### 2. Problem: Calculate the Length of an Arc
**Problem Description:**  
Given the radius of a circle and the central angle in degrees, calculate the length of the arc.

**Solution:**  
First, convert the angle from degrees to radians, then use the formula:  
$$
\text{arc length} = r \times \theta
$$
where $ r $ is the radius and $ \theta $ is the angle in radians.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
import math

def arc_length(radius: float, angle_degrees: int) -> float:
    angle_radians = angle_degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    return radius * angle_radians

# Example usage:
print(arc_length(5, 90))  # Output: 7.853981633974483
```

---

### 3. Problem: Compute the Area of a Sector
**Problem Description:**  
Given the radius of a circle and the central angle in degrees, compute the area of the sector.

**Solution:**  
Convert the angle to radians, then use the formula:  
$$
\text{sector area} = \frac{1}{2} \times r^2 \times \theta
$$
where $ r $ is the radius and $ \theta $ is the angle in radians.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
import math

def sector_area(radius: float, angle_degrees: int) -> float:
    angle_radians = angle_degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    return 0.5 * (radius ** 2) * angle_radians

# Example usage:
print(sector_area(4, 60))  # Output: 8.37758040957278
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `radian_degree` converts an integer `degree` into radians using the formula:
$$
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right)
$$
We use `math.pi` from the `math` module for accurate calculation.

### Python3 code:
```python
import math

def radian_degree(degree: int) -> float:
    return degree * (math.pi / 180)

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The core concept used in solving this problem is **bit manipulation**, specifically the use of **bitwise operations** to find the next power of two. The key idea is to find the position of the highest set bit in the number `n` and then shift 1 left by that position to get the next power of two.

Other relevant algorithms include:
- Bitwise OR and shift operations
- Checking for powers of two using `n & (n - 1) == 0`

## Tutorial:

To find the smallest power of two greater than or equal to a given number `n`, we can use bit manipulation. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. If `n` is 0, return 1 (since 2^0 = 1 is the smallest power of 2).
2. If `n` is already a power of two, return `n`.
3. Otherwise, find the position of the highest set bit in `n`, and then shift 1 left by that position to get the next power of two.

For example, for `n = 5` (binary `101`), the highest set bit is at position 2 (0-indexed), so the next power of two is `1 << 3 = 8`.

An efficient way to do this is:
- If `n` is not a power of two, we can set all the bits after the highest set bit to 1, then add 1 to get the next power of two.

Here¡¯s a common method:
```python
def next_power_of_2(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    n -= 1
    n |= n >> 1
    n |= n >> 2
    n |= n >> 4
    n |= n >> 8
    n |= n >> 16
    return n + 1
```

This works by:
- Subtracting 1 from `n` to ensure that all lower bits are set.
- Using bitwise ORs to propagate the highest bit to all lower bits.
- Adding 1 to get the next power of two.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 204: Count Primes**
- **Problem**: Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative integer `n`.
- **Solution**: While not directly related to powers of two, this problem involves efficient algorithms and bit manipulation (e.g., Sieve of Eratosthenes).
- **Code**:
```python
def countPrimes(n: int) -> int:
    if n < 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
```

### 2. **LeetCode 371: Sum of Two Integers**
- **Problem**: Calculate the sum of two integers without using `+` or `-` operators.
- **Solution**: This problem uses bit manipulation to simulate the addition process.
- **Code**:
```python
def getSum(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    while b != 0:
        carry = a & b
        a = a ^ b
        b = carry << 1
    return a
```

### 3. **LeetCode 231: Power of Two**
- **Problem**: Determine if a given integer is a power of two.
- **Solution**: Use the trick `n & (n - 1) == 0` for checking if a number is a power of two.
- **Code**:
```python
def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:
    return n > 0 and (n & (n - 1)) == 0
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `next_power_of_2` uses bit manipulation to find the next power of two. The steps are:
1. If `n` is 0, return 1.
2. Subtract 1 from `n` to ensure that all bits after the highest set bit are set.
3. Use bitwise ORs to propagate the highest set bit to all lower positions.
4. Add 1 to get the next power of two.

### Python3 code:
```python
def next_power_of_2(n: int) -> int:
    """
    Write a python function to find the smallest power of 2 greater than or equal to n.

    n |= n >> 8
    n |= n >> 16
    return n + 1

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept for this problem is **Regular Expressions (Regex)**. Specifically, we need to match a pattern where:
- The string must start with an 'a'.
- Followed by one or more 'b's (i.e., `b+`).

This can be efficiently done using Python's `re` module which provides functions to match and search for patterns in strings.

---

## Tutorial:
Regular expressions are a powerful tool used to match patterns in strings. They are widely used in competitive programming for pattern matching, string validation, and text processing.

### Key components:
- `^a`: The string must start with the character 'a'.
- `b+`: One or more 'b's.
- `^a+b$`: This pattern ensures that the entire string starts with 'a' followed by one or more 'b's and nothing else.

In Python, the `re` module provides the `fullmatch` function which checks if the entire string matches the given regex pattern.

### Example:
For the string `"ab"`, the pattern `^a+b$` matches because it starts with 'a' and has one 'b'.
For `"aabbb"`, it also matches.
For `"a"`, it does not match because there are no 'b's after 'a'.
For `"abba"`, it does not match because it ends with 'a' after 'b's.

---

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Valid Email Address**
**Description:** Check if a given string is a valid email address, following a simple pattern like: `^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$`

**Solution:** Use regex to match the pattern. The `re.fullmatch()` function ensures the entire string matches the pattern.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
import re

def is_valid_email(email: str) -> bool:
    pattern = r"^[a-zA-Z0-9_.+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+\.[a-zA-Z0-9-.]+$"
    return bool(re.fullmatch(pattern, email))
```

---

### 2. **Problem: Check for a Valid Password**
**Description:** A password is valid if it has at least 8 characters, at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, and one digit.

**Solution:** Use a regex that enforces all these conditions using lookaheads.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
import re

def is_valid_password(password: str) -> bool:
    pattern = r"^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,}$"
    return bool(re.fullmatch(pattern, password))
```

---

### 3. **Problem: Match a Valid Phone Number**
**Description:** Check if a string is a valid phone number in the format: `(123) 456-7890` or `123-456-7890`.

**Solution:** Use a regex pattern that matches both formats.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
import re

def is_valid_phone_number(number: str) -> bool:
    pattern = r"^\(?\d{3}\)?[-.\s]?\d{3}[-.\s]?\d{4}$"
    return bool(re.fullmatch(pattern, number))
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We use Python¡¯s `re.fullmatch()` function to ensure the entire string matches the pattern `^a+b$`. This means:
- The string starts with 'a'.
- Followed by one or more 'b's.
- No other characters are allowed.

### Python3 code:
```python
import re

def text_match_zero_one(text: str) -> bool:
    pattern = r"^a+b$"
    return bool(re.fullmatch(pattern, text))
```

### Example test cases:
```python
print(text_match_zero_one("ab"))      # True
print(text_match_zero_one("aabbb"))   # True
print(text_match_zero_one("a"))       # False
print(text_match_zero_one("abba"))    # False
print(text_match_zero_one("ba"))      # False

---

## Tutorial:
The area of a rectangle is a fundamental concept in geometry. To compute it, you simply multiply the length and the breadth. In programming, this is implemented using a function that takes two integer inputs (length and breadth) and returns their product.

This problem is a good starting point for beginners in competitive programming, as it helps understand how to handle function definitions, input types, and basic arithmetic in Python.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Area of a Square**

```python
def rectangle_perimeter(l: int, b: int) -> int:
    return 2 * (l + b)
```

### 3. **Problem: Area of a Rectangle with Floating Point Inputs**
**Description**: Given the length and breadth of a rectangle as floating-point numbers, compute the area.  
**Solution**: The same formula applies, but the function must handle floats.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:

The problem involves computing a geometric sum, which is a sum of terms in a geometric sequence. The core concept here is **recursion** and **mathematical series**.

A geometric sum of the form:  
`1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(2^(n-1))`  
can be computed recursively or iteratively.

## Tutorial:

A geometric series is a sequence where each term is a constant multiple of the previous one. In this case, the common ratio is `1/2`.

### Recursive Approach:
The function can be defined recursively as:
- Base case: if `n == 0`, return 0 (since the sum of zero terms is 0).
- Recursive case: return `1 / (2 ** (n - 1)) + geometric_sum(n - 1)`.

### Iterative Approach:
Alternatively, you can compute the sum iteratively using a loop, which is more efficient in terms of memory and stack usage.

### Mathematical Formula:
There is also a closed-form formula for the sum of a geometric series:
```
sum = 1 - (1/(2^n))
```
This is valid for a geometric series with first term 1 and common ratio 1/2.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Geometric Sum (LeetCode-like problem)**
**Problem:** Compute the sum of the first n terms of the geometric series: 1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(2^(n-1)).

**Solution:** Use the formula `sum = 1 - 1/(2^n)` for an efficient solution.

```python
def geometric_sum(n):
    return 1 - 1 / (2 ** n)
```

---

### 2. **Sum of Geometric Series (Codeforces)**
**Problem:** Given n, compute the sum of the geometric series: 1 + 3 + 9 + ... + 3^(n-1).

**Solution:** Use the formula for a geometric series:  
`sum = (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)`, where r is the common ratio.

```python
def geometric_sum(n):
    r = 3
    return (r**n - 1) // (r - 1)
```

---

### 3. **Sum of Geometric Sequence (HackerRank)**
**Problem:** Compute the sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence starting with a = 2 and ratio r = 3.

**Solution:** Use the formula `sum = a * (r^n - 1) / (r - 1)`.

```python
def geometric_sum(n):
    a = 2
    r = 3
    return a * (r**n - 1) // (r - 1)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The given function `geometric_sum(n)` is supposed to compute the sum of the geometric series:  
`1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + ... + 1/(2^(n-1))`.

This can be done efficiently using the formula:
```
sum = 1 - 1/(2^n)
```
This formula is derived from the infinite geometric series sum, and it works for finite sums as well.

## Algorithms:
The core concept used in this problem is **filtering** ¡ª specifically, checking each element of a list and including it in the result only if it meets a certain condition. In this case, the condition is that the number is **odd** (i.e., not divisible by 2). This is a common operation in programming and can be efficiently implemented using list comprehensions or loops.

---

## Tutorial:
Filtering is a common operation in programming where you process a list and select only the elements that meet a certain condition. In Python, this can be done using a **list comprehension** like `[x for x in nums if condition]`, which is both concise and efficient.

For the problem of filtering odd numbers:
- We iterate through each number in the input list.
- For each number, we check if it is **odd** by using the modulo operator: `num % 2 != 0`.
- If the condition is true, we include the number in the output list.

This is a basic example of **filtering with a condition**, and it is used in many areas of programming, such as data processing, algorithm design, and more.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 1346: Check If N and Its Double Exist**
- **Problem**: Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exists two indices `i` and `j` such that `arr[i] = 2 * arr[j]` and `i != j`.
- **Solution**: We can use a set to keep track of numbers we've seen so far. For each number, check if `2 * num` or `num / 2` (if even) is in the set.
- **Code**:
```python
def checkIfExist(arr: List[int]) -> bool:
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if 2 * num in seen or num % 2 == 0 and num // 2 in seen:

### 2. **LeetCode 136: Single Number**

- **Solution**: Use the XOR operation. XOR of a number with itself is 0, and XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself.
- **Code**:

    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result

- **Code**:

def maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        else:

    return max_profit
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **string manipulation**, specifically **iterating through a string and selecting characters based on their position** (even or odd indices). The algorithm involves:
- Iterating through the string using a loop.
- Checking the index of each character.
- Including only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) in the result.

This is a **basic string traversal** and **conditional filtering** problem.

---

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, string manipulation is a common task. One typical operation is to filter characters based on their position (index) in the string.

For example, if the input is `"abcdef"`, the even indices (0, 2, 4) correspond to characters `'a'`, `'c'`, and `'e'`. The output would be `"ace"`.

To implement this:
- Loop through the string using `enumerate()` to get both index and character.
- Use a condition to check if the index is even.
- Append the character to a result list or string.

This is a simple but fundamental concept used in many problems involving string transformations, such as removing certain characters, reversing parts of the string, or checking for palindromes.

---

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Remove Even Index Characters (Similar to Original Problem)**

**Problem Description:**  
Given a string, remove all characters that are at even indices (0-based).

**Solution:**  
Iterate through the string using `enumerate`, and collect characters at **odd** indices (since even indices are to be removed).

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def remove_even_indices(s: str) -> str:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if i % 2 == 1:  # odd index
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```

---

### 2. **Reverse Even Index Characters**

**Problem Description:**  
Given a string, reverse the characters that are at even indices.

**Solution:**  
Extract the characters at even indices, reverse them, and then replace them in the original string.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def reverse_even_indices(s: str) -> str:
    chars = list(s)
    even_chars = [chars[i] for i in range(len(chars)) if i % 2 == 0]
    even_chars.reverse()
    for i, char in enumerate(even_chars):
        chars[2 * i] = char
    return ''.join(chars)
```

---

### 3. **Check for Palindrome Using Even and Odd Positions**

**Problem Description:**  
Check if a string is a palindrome by comparing characters at even and odd positions.

**Solution:**  
Compare characters at even indices with their mirrored counterparts and same for odd indices.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
    return True
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The original problem is to **remove odd characters** from the string. In this context, "odd characters" refers to characters at **odd indices** (1, 3, 5, ...). So, we need to:
- Iterate through the string.
- Collect characters at **even indices** (0, 2, 4, ...).
- Join them to form the result string.

### Python3 code:
```python
def remove_odd(str1: str) -> str:
    """
    Write a function to remove odd characters in a string.
    """
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(str1):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # even index
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:

## Algorithms:
The core concept used in this problem is **basic comparison logic**. To find the minimum of three numbers, we can compare them step by step using `if-else` statements or use Python's built-in `min()` function.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, comparing values is a fundamental operation. When you need to find the minimum or maximum of a few numbers, you can do it using simple conditional statements or built-in functions.

For example, to find the minimum of three numbers `a`, `b`, and `c`, you can:
1. Compare `a` and `b`, store the smaller one.
2. Compare the result with `c`, and the final result is the minimum.

Alternatively, in Python, you can directly use the `min()` function, which is efficient and clean.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Find the minimum of two numbers**
**Problem Description**: Given two integers, find the smaller one.

**Solution**: Use a simple `if-else` or the `min()` function.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def min_of_two(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return min(a, b)
```

---

### 2. **Problem: Find the maximum of three numbers**
**Problem Description**: Given three integers, find the largest one.

**Solution**: Use the `max()` function or compare step by step.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def max_of_three(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    return max(a, b, c)
```

---

### 3. **Problem: Find the minimum of four numbers**
**Problem Description**: Given four integers, find the smallest one.

**Solution**: Use the `min()` function with four arguments.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def min_of_four(a: int, b: int, c: int, d: int) -> int:
    return min(a, b, c, d)
```

Include the following points in your response:

## Algorithms:
The core concept here is **string matching**, specifically **substring search**. The problem requires identifying how many times a specific substring ('std') appears in a given string. This can be solved using several methods:
- **Brute-force approach**: Checking every possible substring of length 3 in the given string.
- **KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) algorithm**: A more efficient algorithm for pattern matching.
- **Built-in string methods**: Using Python's `str.count()` method.

## Tutorial:
String matching is a fundamental concept in computer science and competitive programming. It involves searching for a pattern (in this case, the string 'std') within a larger text (the input string).

### Brute-force approach:
In the brute-force method, we iterate through the input string and for each position, check if the substring starting at that position matches the target string. This is straightforward but has a time complexity of O(n * m), where n is the length of the input string and m is the length of the target string.

### KMP algorithm:
The KMP algorithm improves upon the brute-force approach by using a preprocessing step to create a "partial match table" (also known as the failure function). This allows the algorithm to skip unnecessary comparisons, reducing the time complexity to O(n + m).

### Built-in methods:
Python provides a simple and efficient way to count occurrences of a substring using the `str.count()` method. This is a high-level and clean approach.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Count the number of occurrences of a substring**
**Problem:** Given a string `s`, count how many times the substring `'abc'` appears in `s`.

**Solution:** Use the `str.count()` method.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def count_substring(s: str, sub: str) -> int:
    return s.count(sub)

# Example usage:
print(count_substring("abcabcabc", "abc"))  # Output: 3
```

---

### 2. **Find all occurrences of a substring**
**Problem:** Given a string `s`, find all the starting indices where the substring `'xyz'` appears in `s`.

**Solution:** Use a loop to check each possible starting index and compare the substring.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def find_all_occurrences(s: str, sub: str) -> list:
    indices = []
    for i in range(len(s) - len(sub) + 1):
        if s[i:i+len(sub)] == sub:
            indices.append(i)
    return indices

# Example usage:
print(find_all_occurrences("xyzxyzxyz", "xyz"))  # Output: [0, 3, 6]
```

---

### 3. **Implement KMP algorithm for substring search**
**Problem:** Implement the KMP algorithm to count the number of occurrences of a pattern in a text.

**Solution:** First, construct the failure function (partial match table), then use it to efficiently search for the pattern in the text.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def kmp_failure_function(pattern):
    m = len(pattern)
    lps = [0] * m
    length = 0
    i = 1
    while i < m:
        if pattern[i] == pattern[length]:
            length += 1
            lps[i] = length
            i += 1
        else:
            if length != 0:
                length = lps[length - 1]
            else:
                lps[i] = 0
                i += 1
    return lps

def kmp_search(text, pattern):
    n = len(text)
    m = len(pattern)
    lps = kmp_failure_function(pattern)
    i = j = 0
    count = 0
    while i < n:
        if pattern[j] == text[i]:
            i += 1
            j += 1
        if j == m:
            count += 1
            j = lps[j - 1]
        elif i < n and pattern[j] != text[i]:
            if j != 0:
                j = lps[j - 1]
            else:
                i += 1
    return count

# Example usage:
print(kmp_search("abcabcabc", "abc"))  # Output: 3
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We can directly use the `str.count()` method in Python to count the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` in the input string `s`. This is a clean and efficient solution with O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string.

### Python3 code:
```python
def count_occurance(s: str) -> int:
    return s.count('std')

# Example usage:
print(count_occurance("stdstdstd"))  # Output: 3

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **regular expressions (regex)**. The function needs to check whether a given string matches a specific pattern: a string that starts with an 'a' followed by one or more 'b's. This can be efficiently handled using regex, where the pattern `^a+b+$` is used. The `^` ensures the match starts at the beginning of the string, and the `$` ensures it ends at the end.

## Tutorial:
Regular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching in strings. Here's a brief explanation of the regex components used in this problem:

- `^` - Anchors the match to the start of the string.
- `a` - Matches the character 'a'.
- `+` - Quantifier that means "one or more of the preceding element".
- `b` - Matches the character 'b'.
- `+` - Again, means "one or more of the preceding element" (i.e., one or more 'b's).
- `$` - Anchors the match to the end of the string.

So the pattern `^a+b+$` ensures that the string starts with one or more 'a's, followed by one or more 'b's, and nothing else.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: LeetCode 10. Regular Expression Matching
**Description:** Given an input string and a pattern, implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`.

**Solution:** This problem requires a dynamic programming approach to match the pattern with the string. The `'.'` matches any single character, and `'*'` matches zero or more of the preceding element.

**Code:**
```python
def is_match(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
    dp = [[False] * (len(p) + 1) for _ in range(len(s) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = True

    for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]

    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        for j in range(1, len(p) + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '*':
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2] or (dp[i - 1][j] and p[j - 2] in (s[i - 1], '.'))
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] and p[j - 1] in (s[i - 1], '.')

    return dp[-1][-1]

### Problem 2: Codeforces 110A. Nearly Lucky Number
**Description:** A number is called nearly lucky if the number of its digits that are equal to 4 or 7 is itself a lucky number (i.e., consists only of 4 and 7).

**Solution:** This problem uses basic string manipulation and counting. We count the number of '4's and '7's and then check if that count is a lucky number.

**Code:**
```python
def is_lucky(n):
    return all(c in {'4', '7'} for c in str(n))

def is_nearly_lucky(n):
    count = str(n).count('4') + str(n).count('7')
    return is_lucky(count)

# Example usage:
print(is_nearly_lucky(447))  # True
```

### Problem 3: HackerRank - Regex and Parsing - Validating Phone Numbers
**Description:** You are given `n` lines of strings. Each string is a phone number, and you must determine if it is valid.

**Solution:** A valid phone number is 10 digits starting with 7, 8, or 9.

**Code:**
```python
import re

n = int(input())
for _ in range(n):
    phone = input()
    if re.fullmatch(r'[789]\d{9}', phone):
        print("Valid")
    else:
        print("Invalid")
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We use the `re` module in Python to match the given string against the regex pattern `^a+b+$`. The `re.fullmatch()` function ensures that the entire string matches the pattern.

import re

def text_match_one(text: str) -> bool:

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
This problem involves **dynamic programming (DP)**. The core concept is to build up the solution for `n` posts based on the number of ways to paint fewer posts, considering constraints on adjacent colors.

The key recurrence relations are:
- `dp[n] = (dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]) * (k-1)`
This formula considers two cases:
1. The `n`-th post has a different color from the `(n-1)`-th post.
2. The `n`-th post has the same color as the `(n-1)`-th post, but not the same as the `(n-2)`-th post.

## Tutorial:
This problem is a classic example of dynamic programming with constraints. The idea is to use a recurrence relation that builds on smaller subproblems.

Let¡¯s define:
- `dp[n]` as the number of ways to paint `n` posts with `k` colors such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color.

### Base Cases:
- `dp[1] = k` (only one post, can be painted in `k` ways)
- `dp[2] = k * k` (two posts, each can be painted in `k` ways)

### Recurrence:
For `n >= 3`:
- The `n`-th post can be painted in `k-1` ways if it's different from the `(n-1)`-th post.
- The `n`-th post can be painted in `k-1` ways if it's the same as the `(n-1)`-th post but different from the `(n-2)`-th post.

So, the recurrence is:
```
dp[n] = (dp[n-1] + dp[n-2]) * (k - 1)
```

This recurrence ensures that no more than 2 adjacent posts have the same color.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Painting Fence (LeetCode 276)**

**Problem:**  
Given `n` posts and `k` colors, count the number of ways to paint the fence such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color.

**Solution:**  
Use the recurrence relation above. We can optimize space by keeping only the last two values.

**Python Code:**
```python
def numWays(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * k

    prev_prev = k  # dp[1]
    prev = k * k  # dp[2]

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        curr = (prev + prev_prev) * (k - 1)
        prev_prev, prev = prev, curr

    return prev
```

---

### 2. **Fence Painting (LeetCode 276 - variant)**

**Problem:**  
Same as above but with different constraints (e.g., no more than 1 adjacent same color).

**Solution:**  
If no two adjacent posts can have the same color, then:
- `dp[n] = (dp[n-1] * (k-1))`

**Python Code:**
```python
def numWays(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    if n == 1:
        return k
    if n == 2:
        return k * (k - 1)

    prev_prev = k  # dp[1]
    prev = k * (k - 1)  # dp[2]

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        curr = prev * (k - 1)
        prev_prev, prev = prev, curr

    return prev
```

---

### 3. **Staircase with Different Ways (LeetCode 70)**

**Problem:**  
You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. How many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Solution:**  
This is a classic Fibonacci DP problem.

**Python Code:**
```python
def climbStairs(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    if n == 2:
        return 2

    prev_prev = 1
    prev = 2

    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        curr = prev + prev_prev
        prev_prev, prev = prev, curr

    return prev
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We use dynamic programming to compute the number of ways to paint `n` posts with `k` colors such that at most 2 adjacent posts have the same color. We optimize the space by only storing the last two results, as the recurrence only depends on the previous two values.

### Python3 code:

def count_no_of_ways(n: int, k: int) -> int:

## Algorithms:
The core concept here is **modular arithmetic**, specifically **modular multiplication**. Since the product of a large array can be very large and may exceed the limits of standard integer types, we compute the product modulo `n` step by step to avoid overflow and ensure efficiency.

## Tutorial:
Modular arithmetic is a system of arithmetic for integers where numbers "wrap around" upon reaching a certain value ¡ª the modulus. In this problem, we are asked to compute the product of all elements in the array, and then take the modulo `n` of that product.

The key idea is to compute the product incrementally while taking the modulo at each step. This is because:
- (a * b) % n = ((a % n) * (b % n)) % n
- This prevents the intermediate product from becoming too large.

This approach is efficient and avoids integer overflow, especially when dealing with large arrays or large numbers.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: **Multiplication Modulo (Codeforces 71A)**
**Description**: Given an array of integers, compute the product of all elements modulo `n`.

**Solution**: Iterate through the array, multiply each element with the result, and take modulo `n` at each step.

**Python3 Code:**

        result = (result * num) % n

### Problem 2: **Modular Exponentiation (LeetCode 50)**
**Description**: Compute `pow(a, b, mod)` efficiently using modular exponentiation.

**Solution**: Use the fast exponentiation method with modulo at each step to avoid overflow.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def pow_mod(a, b, mod):
    result = 1
    a = a % mod
    while b > 0:
        if b % 2 == 1:
            result = (result * a) % mod
        a = (a * a) % mod
        b //= 2
    return result
```

---

### Problem 3: **Product of Array Except Self (LeetCode 238)**
**Description**: Compute an array where each element is the product of all elements in the input array except the current one. Use modulo `n` for large values.

**Solution**: Compute prefix and suffix products, then multiply them while applying modulo `n`.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def product_exclude_self(nums, n):
    length = len(nums)
    left = [1] * length
    right = [1] * length
    result = [0] * length

    for i in range(1, length):
        left[i] = (left[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]) % n

    for i in range(length - 2, -1, -1):
        right[i] = (right[i + 1] * nums[i + 1]) % n

    for i in range(length):
        result[i] = (left[i] * right[i]) % n

    return result
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We are given an array of integers and a number `n`. We need to compute the product of all elements in the array and then return the result modulo `n`.

To do this efficiently:
1. Initialize a variable `result` to 1.
2. Iterate through each number in the array.
3. Multiply `result` by the current number, and then take modulo `n` to avoid overflow.
4. Return the final result.

- Explanation of the solution:

## Algorithms:

The core concept in this problem is **tuple traversal and element checking**. The function `check_K` is expected to check whether a given integer `K` is present in a list of integers (which is treated as a tuple). This is a basic problem involving **linear search** and **membership testing** in Python.

## Tutorial:

In Python, a list is a mutable sequence, and a tuple is an immutable sequence. However, for the purpose of this problem, the list is treated as a tuple. The function `check_K` takes a list (or tuple) of integers and an integer `K`, and returns `True` if `K` is present in the list, otherwise `False`.

This is a simple problem that can be solved using Python's built-in `in` operator. The `in` operator checks for membership in a sequence (like a list or tuple) and returns `True` if the element is found, otherwise `False`.

For example:
```python
test_tup = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
K = 3
if K in test_tup:
    print("Found")
else:
    print("Not found")
```

This is a linear time algorithm (O(n)), where n is the length of the list. It's efficient enough for small to moderately sized lists.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Check if a Number is Present in a List (LeetCode 217)**
**Problem Description:**  
Given an integer array `nums`, return `True` if any value appears at least twice in the array, and return `False` if every element is distinct.

**Solution:**  
We can use a set to check for duplicates. A set in Python has O(1) average time complexity for membership checks.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def contains_duplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

### 2. **Find the First Occurrence of a Target in a Sorted Array (LeetCode 34)**
**Problem Description:**  
Given a sorted array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, find the index of the first occurrence of `target`. If the target is not found, return `-1`.

**Solution:**  
We can use binary search to find the first occurrence. Binary search is an efficient algorithm with O(log n) time complexity.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def search_first_occurrence(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    result = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            right = mid - 1  # Look for earlier occurrence
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return result
```

### 3. **Check if All Characters in a String are Unique (LeetCode 217)**
**Problem Description:**  
Given a string, return `True` if all the characters in the string are unique, otherwise return `False`.

**Solution:**  
We can use a set to check for duplicate characters. If the length of the string is equal to the length of the set of its characters, then all characters are unique.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def is_unique_chars(s: str) -> bool:
    return len(set(s)) == len(s)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `check_K` is designed to check whether the integer `K` exists in the given list `test_tup`. Since the input is a list (which is similar to a tuple), we can directly use the `in` operator in Python to check for the presence of `K`.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def check_K(test_tup: List[int], K: int) -> bool:
    """
    Check if the given list contains the integer K.
    """
    return K in test_tup

## Algorithms:

The core concept used in solving the problem of checking whether an array is monotonic is **tracking the direction of change** in the array. A monotonic array is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. This can be checked by comparing adjacent elements and tracking whether the array is increasing, decreasing, or neither.

The algorithm involves:
- Iterating through the array and checking the direction of each pair of consecutive elements.
- Using flags to track whether the array is increasing, decreasing, or neither.
- If the array changes direction (from increasing to decreasing or vice versa), it is not monotonic.

## Tutorial:

A **monotonic array** is one that is either entirely non-decreasing or non-increasing. For example:
- `[1, 2, 2, 3]` is monotonic (non-decreasing).
- `[5, 4, 3, 3]` is monotonic (non-increasing).
- `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]` is not monotonic because it first increases and then decreases.

To check for monotonicity:
- We can track two boolean flags: `increasing` and `decreasing`.
- Initialize both to `True`.
- As we iterate through the array, if we find an element that is less than the previous one, the `increasing` flag becomes `False`.
- If we find an element that is greater than the previous one, the `decreasing` flag becomes `False`.
- After the loop, if either `increasing` or `decreasing` is still `True`, the array is monotonic.

This is an efficient O(n) time and O(1) space algorithm.

## Example Problems:

### 1. LeetCode - 896. Monotonic Array
**Problem Description:**  
An array is monotonic if it is either entirely non-increasing or non-decreasing. Return `True` if the array is monotonic, otherwise `False`.

**Solution:**  
Use the same logic as above. Track `increasing` and `decreasing` flags.

**Python Code:**
```python
def isMonotonic(A: List[int]) -> bool:
    increasing = True
    decreasing = True
    for i in range(1, len(A)):
        if A[i] > A[i-1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif A[i] < A[i-1]:
            increasing = False
        if not increasing and not decreasing:
            return False
    return True
```

### 2. Codeforces - 1475A. Odd Divisor
**Problem Description:**  
Given an integer `n`, determine if it has an odd divisor greater than 1.

**Solution:**  
This is not directly related to monotonic arrays, but the concept of checking direction or properties in a sequence can be applied. The solution involves checking if `n` is a power of 2 (which has no odd divisors other than 1).

**Python Code:**
```python
def has_odd_divisor(n):
    while n % 2 == 0:
        n //= 2
    return n != 1
```

### 3. LeetCode - 1122. Relative Sort Array
**Problem Description:**  
Sort the elements of `arr1` in the order defined by `arr2`. Elements not in `arr2` should appear at the end in ascending order.

**Solution:**  
This problem involves sorting with custom rules, which is different from monotonicity, but it uses the idea of tracking order and direction, similar to how we check for monotonicity.

**Python Code:**
```python
from collections import Counter

def relativeSort(arr1, arr2):
    count = Counter(arr1)
    result = []
    for num in arr2:
        result.extend([num] * count[num])
        del count[num]
    for num in sorted(count):
        result.extend([num] * count[num])
    return result
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We will use two flags: `increasing` and `decreasing`. As we iterate through the array, we check the relationship between consecutive elements. If an element is greater than the previous, the `decreasing` flag is set to `False`. If it is smaller, the `increasing` flag is set to `False`. If both flags are `False`, the array is not monotonic.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def is_Monotonic(A: List[int]) -> bool:
    increasing = True
    decreasing = True
    for i in range(1, len(A)):
        if A[i] > A[i-1]:
            decreasing = False
        elif A[i] < A[i-1]:
            increasing = False
        if not increasing and not decreasing:
            return False
    return True
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The problem involves understanding the geometric properties of a parabola, specifically the equation of the directrix. The key concepts include:
- Understanding the standard form of a parabola.
- Using the formula for the directrix of a parabola in the form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $.

## Tutorial:
A parabola is a U-shaped curve that is symmetric about its axis. The equation of a parabola in standard form is $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, where $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $ are constants.

For a parabola in this form, the vertex is located at $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. The directrix is a horizontal line that is located at a distance equal to $ \frac{1}{4a} $ from the vertex, but on the opposite side of the focus. The equation of the directrix is:

$$
y = -\frac{1}{4a} - \frac{b^2}{4a} + c
$$

Simplifying this, the directrix is:

$$
y = c - \frac{b^2}{4a} - \frac{1}{4a} = c - \frac{b^2 + 1}{4a}
$$

So, to find the directrix of a parabola given $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, we compute:

$$
\text{Directrix} = c - \frac{b^2 + 1}{4a}
$$

This formula gives the y-coordinate of the directrix, which is a horizontal line.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Directrix of a Parabola
**Problem Description**: Given the coefficients of a parabola $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $, find the equation of its directrix.

**Solution**: Use the formula $ y = c - \frac{b^2 + 1}{4a} $.

**Python Code**:
```python
def directrix(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> int:
    return c - (b * b + 1) // (4 * a)
```

### Problem 2: Vertex of a Parabola
**Problem Description**: Given $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, find the vertex of the parabola $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $.

**Solution**: The x-coordinate of the vertex is $ x = -\frac{b}{2a} $. The y-coordinate is found by substituting this x into the equation.

**Python Code**:
```python
def vertex(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> tuple:
    x = -b / (2 * a)
    y = a * x * x + b * x + c
    return (x, y)
```

### Problem 3: Focus of a Parabola
**Problem Description**: Given $ a $, $ b $, and $ c $, find the focus of the parabola $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $.

**Solution**: The focus lies at the same x-coordinate as the vertex, and its y-coordinate is the vertex y-coordinate plus $ \frac{1}{4a} $.

**Python Code**:
```python
def focus(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> tuple:
    x = -b / (2 * a)
    y = a * x * x + b * x + c + 1 / (4 * a)
    return (x, y)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `parabola_directrix` computes the y-coordinate of the directrix for a parabola in the form $ y = ax^2 + bx + c $. Using the formula $ y = c - \frac{b^2 + 1}{4a} $, we calculate the directrix and return it as an integer.

## Algorithms:
The core concept used in this problem is **element-wise division of two lists**. This involves iterating through both lists simultaneously and dividing the corresponding elements. It is a straightforward application of **looping** and **list operations** in Python.

## Tutorial:
Element-wise operations on lists are common in competitive programming and scientific computing. When given two lists of equal length, you can perform operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division on each corresponding pair of elements.

For example, given two lists:
- `nums1 = [4, 6, 8]`
- `nums2 = [2, 3, 4]`

The element-wise division would be:
- `result = [4/2, 6/3, 8/4] = [2.0, 2.0, 2.0]`

In Python, you can use a `for` loop or a list comprehension to achieve this. You must also ensure that the lists are of the same length and that there is no division by zero.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Element-Wise Multiplication
**Description**: Given two lists of integers, return a new list where each element is the product of the corresponding elements in the input lists.

**Solution**: Use a list comprehension to iterate through the elements of both lists and multiply them.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def mult_list(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [a * b for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]
```

---

### Problem 2: Element-Wise Sum
**Description**: Given two lists of integers, return a new list where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements in the input lists.

**Solution**: Use a `for` loop or list comprehension to add the elements of both lists.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def add_list(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    return [a + b for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]
```

---

### Problem 3: Element-Wise Division with Zero Handling
**Description**: Given two lists of integers, return a new list where each element is the division of the corresponding elements. If division by zero occurs, return `None` for that position.

**Solution**: Use a list comprehension with a conditional to handle division by zero.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
from typing import List, Optional

def safe_div_list(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[Optional[float]]:
    return [a / b if b != 0 else None for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `div_list` takes two lists of integers, `nums1` and `nums2`, and returns a list of floats where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `nums1` by `nums2`.

We use `zip(nums1, nums2)` to iterate through both lists simultaneously, and then divide each pair of elements. Since the output is a list of floats, we perform floating-point division using `/`.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def div_list(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[float]:
    return [a / b for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **tuple manipulation and string concatenation**. The function needs to take a tuple of mixed types (strings and an integer) and concatenate all its elements into a single string, using a delimiter (which is not specified in the problem, but it's implied to be a standard one like a space or a hyphen).

This is a basic string operation, often used in data processing and formatting.

## Tutorial:
In Python, tuples are immutable sequences, often used to group related data. To concatenate the elements of a tuple, we need to:

1. Convert all elements to strings (since the tuple contains a mix of `str` and `int`).
2. Use the `join()` method to concatenate the string elements with a delimiter.

For example, if the tuple is `('a', 'b', 1, 'c')`, we first convert each element to a string: `['a', 'b', '1', 'c']`, then join them with a delimiter, say `'-'`, to get `'a-b-1-c'`.

This is a common operation in data processing where you need to format or serialize data.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Concatenate Strings from a Tuple**
**Description:** Given a tuple of strings, return a single string with all elements joined by a space.

**Solution:** Convert each element to a string (though they are already strings), then use `' '.join(tup)`.

**Code:**
```python
def concatenate_strings(tup):
    return ' '.join(str(x) for x in tup)
```

### 2. **Problem: Join Tuple Elements with a Custom Delimiter**
**Description:** Given a tuple of mixed types (strings and integers), return a single string where all elements are joined with a specified delimiter.

**Solution:** Convert all elements to strings and then use the `join` method with the given delimiter.

**Code:**
```python
def join_tuple(tup, delimiter):
    return delimiter.join(str(x) for x in tup)
```

### 3. **Problem: Format a Tuple as a Sentence**
**Description:** Given a tuple of words and a number, return a sentence like "The result is X".

**Solution:** Convert the number to a string and use string formatting to build the sentence.

**Code:**
```python
def format_sentence(tup):
    return f"The result is {tup[2]}"
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `concatenate_tuple` takes a tuple of mixed types (`str`, `str`, `int`, `str`). To concatenate them into a single string, we convert all elements to strings and then join them using a delimiter. Since the problem does not specify a delimiter, we will use a space `' '` as the default.

### Python3 code:

def concatenate_tuple(test_tup: Tuple[str, str, int, str]) -> str:
    """

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **basic list and tuple manipulation in Python**. The function needs to add the elements of the tuple to the list. This involves understanding how to iterate over a tuple and append its elements to a list.

## Tutorial:
In Python, a list is a mutable collection of elements, while a tuple is an immutable collection. To add elements from a tuple to a list, you can use a loop or the `extend()` method. Since tuples are iterable, you can loop through their elements and append them to the list. Alternatively, the `extend()` method can be used to add all elements of the tuple to the list in one step.

For example:
```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_tuple = (4, 5)
my_list.extend(my_tuple)
# Now my_list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This is a fundamental operation in many programming tasks, especially when dealing with data structures and input/output.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 1. Two Sum**
**Problem Description:** Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`.

**Solution:** This problem involves using a hash map (dictionary) to store the value-to-index mapping for quick lookup. The algorithm is O(n) time complexity.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def twoSum(nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
    num_map = {}
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        complement = target - num
        if complement in num_map:
            return [num_map[complement], i]
        num_map[num] = i
    return []
```

### 2. **LeetCode 217. Contains Duplicate**
**Problem Description:** Given an array of integers, determine if the array contains any duplicates.

**Solution:** Use a set to store elements as we iterate through the list. If an element is already in the set, return `True`.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def containsDuplicate(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    seen = set()
    for num in nums:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False
```

### 3. **LeetCode 26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array**
**Problem Description:** Given a sorted array, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appears only once and return the new length.

**Solution:** Use a two-pointer approach. One pointer tracks the position to place the next unique element, and the other iterates through the array.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def removeDuplicates(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if not nums:
        return 0
    i = 0
    for j in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[j] != nums[i]:
            i += 1
            nums[i] = nums[j]
    return i + 1
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `add_tuple` takes a list and a tuple as inputs. The goal is to add the elements of the tuple to the list. Since the tuple is iterable, we can use the `extend()` method to add all elements of the tuple to the list.

## Algorithms:
The problem involves **array rotation** and **efficient querying**. The core concepts used are:

1. **Understanding array rotation**: When an array is rotated, the elements shift positions. For example, rotating an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` once results in `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.

2. **Tracking the position of an element after multiple rotations**: Instead of performing actual rotations (which is inefficient), we can compute the **effective index** of the original array that would end up at the given `index` after `rotations`.

3. **Mathematical computation**: For each rotation, the index of an element changes. We can compute the original index by reversing the rotation effect.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, when dealing with array rotations, we often need to find the value at a specific index after a certain number of rotations. Instead of simulating the rotation, which would be O(n) per rotation, we can compute the effective index in O(1) time using modular arithmetic.

For a single rotation (right rotation), the element at index `i` moves to `(i + 1) % n`. So, to reverse the effect of `rotations` rotations, we can compute the original index as:

```
original_index = (index - rotations) % n
```

If the result is negative, we adjust it to be within the range [0, n-1].

This is efficient and works even for large values of `rotations`.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 189: Rotate Array**
**Problem Description**: Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

**Solution**: Instead of rotating the array, we can compute the effective index of each element using modular arithmetic.

```python
def rotate(nums: List[int], k: int) -> None:
    n = len(nums)
    k = k % n

### 2. **Codeforces Round #251 (Div. 2) Problem B: Three Base**
**Problem Description**: Given a number in base 3, rotate its digits and find the value in base 10 after some rotations.

**Solution**: Use modular arithmetic to compute the effective position of the digit after a number of rotations.

```python
def find_rotated_number(s: str, rotations: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    rotations = rotations % n
    s = s[-rotations:] + s[:-rotations]
    return int(s, 3)
```

### 3. **AtCoder Beginner Contest 122 C: Geometric Progression**
**Problem Description**: Given a sequence of numbers, perform multiple rotations and find the value at a specific index.

**Solution**: Use the same concept of computing the original index after rotations.

```python
def find_element_after_rotations(arr: List[int], rotations: int, index: int) -> int:
    n = len(arr)
    original_index = (index - rotations) % n
    return arr[original_index]
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `find_Element` takes an array `arr`, a list of ranges (though not used in this problem), the number of rotations `rotations`, and an `index`. The goal is to find the value at the given `index` after performing `rotations` right rotations.

Since the `ranges` are not used, we can ignore them. We calculate the original index as `(index - rotations) % len(arr)` to account for the rotation effect.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:

from typing import List

def find_Element(arr: List[int], ranges: List[List[int]], rotations: int, index: int) -> int:
    """
    Write a python function to find element at a given index after number of rotations.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept involved in solving this problem is **tuple manipulation** and **dictionary construction**. The function needs to take a tuple of even length and convert it into a dictionary where each pair of adjacent elements in the tuple becomes a key-value pair.

This is a straightforward process:
1. Iterate through the tuple in steps of 2.
2. For each pair (i, i+1), use the first element as the key and the second as the value.
3. Add this pair to the dictionary.

## Tutorial:
In Python, tuples are immutable sequences, and dictionaries are mutable mappings of keys to values. To convert a tuple into a dictionary with adjacent elements as key-value pairs, we can use a loop to iterate over the tuple in pairs.

For example, given the tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the resulting dictionary should be `{1: 2, 3: 4}`.

The key idea is to use a loop with a step of 2 to access the keys and then use the next element as the value. This approach is efficient and works well for tuples of even length.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Convert a Tuple to a Dictionary with Adjacent Pairs
**Problem Description**: Given a tuple of even length, convert it into a dictionary using adjacent elements as key-value pairs.

**Solution**: Iterate over the tuple in steps of 2, and for each index, use the element at that index as the key and the next element as the value.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def tuple_to_dict(test_tup):
    result = {}
    for i in range(0, len(test_tup), 2):
        result[test_tup[i]] = test_tup[i+1]
    return result
```

### Problem 2: Convert a List of Tuples to a Dictionary
**Problem Description**: Given a list of 2-tuples, convert it into a dictionary where the first element of each tuple is the key and the second is the value.

**Solution**: Iterate through the list and build the dictionary by assigning the first element as the key and the second as the value.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def list_of_tuples_to_dict(tuples_list):
    result = {}
    for key, value in tuples_list:
        result[key] = value
    return result
```

### Problem 3: Convert a String to a Dictionary of Character Counts
**Problem Description**: Given a string, create a dictionary where each key is a character from the string and the value is the number of times it appears.

**Solution**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in the string.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def string_to_dict(s):
    result = {}
    for char in s:
        result[char] = result.get(char, 0) + 1
    return result
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `tuple_to_dict` takes a tuple of six integers. Since the tuple is guaranteed to be of even length (6), we can safely iterate over it in steps of 2. For each index `i`, we take the element at `i` as the key and the element at `i+1` as the value, and add them to the dictionary.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import Tuple, Dict

def tuple_to_dict(test_tup: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int]) -> Dict[int, int]:
    result = {}
    for i in range(0, len(test_tup), 2):
        result[test_tup[i]] = test_tup[i + 1]
    return result

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept used in this problem is **binary search**. Since the list is sorted and contains natural numbers (starting from 1), we can efficiently find the smallest missing number by checking the position of elements and comparing them with their indices.

The key idea is to find the first index where the value is **greater than the index + 1**. That is, for a sorted list of natural numbers, the value at index `i` should be `i + 1`. If it's not, then the missing number is `i + 1`.

## Tutorial:
To find the smallest missing number in a **sorted list of natural numbers**, we can use **binary search**. Here's the logic:

1. Initialize `left = 0` and `right = len(array) - 1`.
2. While `left <= right`:
   - Compute the `mid = (left + right) // 2`.
   - If `array[mid] > mid + 1`, then the missing number is somewhere in the left half. Set `right = mid - 1`.
   - Else, the missing number is in the right half. Set `left = mid + 1`.
3. After the loop, the missing number is `left + 1`.

This works because in a perfect sorted list of natural numbers starting from 1, the value at index `i` should be `i + 1`. If any value is greater than that, a number is missing before that index.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: LeetCode 268. Missing Number
**Description**: Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers taken from the range `0` to `n`, find the missing number.

**Solution**: Use binary search. Since the array is sorted, we can find the first index where `nums[i] > i`, which means the missing number is `i`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def missingNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] > mid:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left
```

### Problem 2: Codeforces 1353A. Most Unstable Array
**Description**: Given an array of `n` elements, find the maximum sum of the array if you can change at most one element to any value.

**Solution**: This is not directly a binary search problem, but it¡¯s a good example of how to think about array properties and find missing elements in a different context.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def max_unstable_sum(n, a):
    return max(sum(a) + max(a) - min(a), sum(a))
```

---

### Problem 3: HackerRank "Missing Numbers"
**Description**: Given two arrays of integers, find the numbers that are present in the first array but missing in the second.

**Solution**: Use a hash map or frequency count to find the missing numbers.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
from collections import Counter

def missing_numbers(arr, brr):
    count_b = Counter(brr)
    result = []
    for num in arr:
        if count_b[num] == 0:
            result.append(num)
        else:
            count_b[num] -= 1
    return result
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We use binary search to efficiently find the smallest missing natural number in a sorted list. Since the list is sorted, we can compare the value at each index to `index + 1`. The first index where `array[i] > i + 1` indicates that `i + 1` is the missing number. If no such index is found, the missing number is `len(array) + 1`.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List

def find_First_Missing(array: List[int]) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(array) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concepts used in solving this problem are:

- **Type Checking and Conversion**: Since the list contains mixed types (e.g., strings and integers), we need to identify which elements are integers and which are strings. We can convert strings to integers if they represent valid numbers.
- **Filtering and Comparison**: We filter out non-integer values and then find the maximum value among the valid integers.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, handling heterogeneous data is a common task. When dealing with a list that contains elements of different types (like `int`, `str`, etc.), the first step is to **filter out the elements that are relevant to the problem**.

For example, in this problem, we are asked to find the **maximum value** in a list that may contain strings and integers. The key steps are:

1. **Iterate through the list** and check the type of each element.
2. **Convert strings to integers** if they can be parsed as valid integers.
3. **Ignore elements that cannot be converted** to integers.
4. **Track the maximum value** found during the iteration.

This approach is efficient and commonly used in problems where input data is not strictly typed.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Maximum in a Mixed List
**Description**: Given a list with mixed types (strings and integers), find the maximum integer value.

**Solution**: Iterate through the list, check the type of each element, and convert strings to integers if possible. Keep track of the maximum value found.

**Python Code**:
```python
def max_val(listval: List[Union[str, int]]) -> int:
    max_int = None
    for val in listval:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            current = val
        elif isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                current = int(val)
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            continue
        if max_int is None or current > max_int:
            max_int = current
    return max_int
```

---

### Problem 2: Sum of Numbers in a Mixed List
**Description**: Given a list with mixed types, sum all the numeric values (integers and strings that can be converted to integers).

**Solution**: Similar to the above, iterate through the list, check for integers or convertable strings, and add them to a running total.

**Python Code**:
```python
def sum_numbers(listval: List[Union[str, int]]) -> int:
    total = 0
    for val in listval:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            total += val
        elif isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                total += int(val)
            except ValueError:
                pass
    return total
```

---

### Problem 3: Find the Longest Valid Number String
**Description**: Given a list of strings and integers, find the longest string that can be converted to an integer.

**Solution**: Iterate through the list, check if the element is a string, and whether it can be converted to an integer. Track the longest such string.

**Python Code**:
```python
def longest_valid_number(listval: List[Union[str, int]]) -> str:
    max_str = ""
    for val in listval:
        if isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                int(val)
                if len(val) > len(max_str):
                    max_str = val
            except ValueError:
                pass
    return max_str
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `max_val` takes a list of mixed types (integers and strings). It iterates through the list, and for each element:
- If it is an integer, it directly compares it.
- If it is a string, it tries to convert it to an integer.
- If the conversion fails, it skips the element.
- It keeps track of the maximum value encountered and returns it.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import List, Union

def max_val(listval: List[Union[str, int]]) -> int:
    max_int = None
    for val in listval:
        if isinstance(val, int):
            current = val
        elif isinstance(val, str):
            try:
                current = int(val)
            except ValueError:
                continue
        else:
            continue
        if max_int is None or current > max_int:
            max_int = current
    return max_int

Provide three examples of relevant competitive programming problems that involve these algorithms. For each problem , describe the problem , explain the solution in detail , and then write the correct Python3 code.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem: 
Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concepts used in solving this problem involve:
- **String traversal**: Iterating through each character in the input string.
- **Character comparison**: Comparing each character with its corresponding position in the English alphabet.
- **Case insensitivity**: Converting both the character and the alphabet letter to the same case (e.g., lowercase) to avoid case mismatches.
- **Index calculation**: Using the ASCII value of a character to determine its position in the English alphabet.

## Tutorial:
The problem is to count how many characters in a string are in the same position as they are in the English alphabet. For example, 'a' is the first letter, 'b' the second, and so on. We compare each character in the input string to its position in the alphabet, ignoring case.

To solve this:
1. Iterate over each character in the string.
2. For each character, convert it to lowercase.
3. Calculate its position in the alphabet by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the character's ASCII value. For example, `ord('a') = 97`, so `ord('a') - ord('a') = 0`, `ord('b') - ord('a') = 1`, etc.
4. Compare this position with the index of the character in the string (starting from 0).
5. If they match, increment the count.

This is a simple loop-based algorithm with O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the string.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Check if a string is a palindrome**
- **Description**: A string is a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.
- **Solution**: Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning and one at the end of the string, and compare characters while moving inward.
- **Python3 Code**:
```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    left = 0
    right = len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        if s[left] != s[right]:
            return False
        left += 1
        right -= 1
    return True
```

### 2. **Problem: Count the number of vowels in a string**
- **Description**: Count the number of characters in a string that are vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
- **Solution**: Traverse the string and check if each character is in the set of vowels.
- **Python3 Code**:
```python
def count_vowels(s: str) -> int:
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    return sum(1 for char in s.lower() if char in vowels)
```

### 3. **Problem: Check if a string contains all letters of the alphabet**
- **Description**: Determine if a string contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet.
- **Solution**: Use a set to store characters and check if the set contains all letters from 'a' to 'z'.
- **Python3 Code**:
```python
def contains_all_alphabet(s: str) -> bool:
    return set(s.lower()) >= set('abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz')
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- We iterate through each character in the string.
- For each character, we convert it to lowercase.
- We calculate its position in the alphabet by using `ord(char) - ord('a')`.
- We compare this position with the index of the character in the string (starting from 0).
- If they match, we increment the count.

### Python3 code:
```python
def count_char_position(str1: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i, char in enumerate(str1.lower()):
        if ord(char) - ord('a') == i:
            count += 1
    return count

## Algorithms:

The core concept used in this problem is **mathematical range checking** and **perfect square identification**. The algorithm involves:
- Finding the smallest integer `x` such that `x^2 >= a`
- Finding the largest integer `y` such that `y^2 <= b`
- Generating all perfect squares between `x^2` and `y^2`

This problem is a simple application of **mathematical properties of squares** and **range iteration**.

---

## Tutorial:

A **perfect square** is a number that is the square of an integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16, etc. To find all perfect squares between two numbers `a` and `b`, we can:
1. Use the square root function to find the smallest and largest integers whose squares fall in the range.
2. Iterate from the smallest to the largest integer and collect their squares.

In Python, we can use `math.isqrt()` (available in Python 3.8+) to compute the integer square root, which returns the floor of the square root of a number. This helps us find the starting and ending points for the perfect squares.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- Find the smallest integer `x` such that `x^2 >= a` using `math.isqrt(a)`.
- Find the largest integer `y` such that `y^2 <= b` using `math.isqrt(b)`.
- Iterate from `x` to `y` and collect all squares `i*i`.

### Python3 code:

## Algorithms:
The core concept in this problem is **checking for the presence of a specific value (None) in a tuple**. This is a simple **linear search** or **membership check** operation, which involves iterating through the elements of the tuple and checking if any of them is `None`.

## Tutorial:
In Python, tuples are immutable sequences of elements. To check if a tuple contains a `None` value, we can use a simple loop or the `in` operator, which checks for membership in the tuple.

The `in` operator is efficient and concise for this purpose. It checks whether the given value (`None` in this case) exists in the tuple. If it does, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This is a fundamental operation in programming, and understanding how to check for membership in collections like tuples, lists, and sets is essential for solving more complex problems.

## Example Problems:

### 1. Problem: Check for Zero in a List
**Description:** Given a list of integers, determine if the list contains the number 0.

**Solution:** Use the `in` operator to check if `0` is in the list.

**Code:**
```python
def has_zero(lst):
    return 0 in lst
```

### 2. Problem: Check for Duplicates in a List
**Description:** Given a list, determine if there are any duplicate elements.

**Solution:** Use a set to check for duplicates. Convert the list to a set and compare its length with the original list.

**Code:**
```python
def has_duplicates(lst):
    return len(set(lst)) != len(lst)
```

### 3. Problem: Check for a Specific Element in a Tuple
**Description:** Given a tuple, determine if it contains a specific value.

**Solution:** Use the `in` operator to check for the presence of the value in the tuple.

**Code:**
```python
def contains_value(tup, value):
    return value in tup
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `check_none` takes a tuple `test_tup` as input and checks if `None` is present in it. This is done using the `in` operator, which efficiently checks for the presence of `None` in the tuple.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import Any

def check_none(test_tup: Any) -> bool:
    """
    Write a function to check if the given tuple has any None value or not.

## Algorithms:

The core concept used in solving this problem is **array traversal and element-wise computation**. Specifically, the problem involves iterating through a list and computing the product of adjacent elements. This is a simple yet common pattern in competitive programming, often used in problems involving sequences, arrays, and transformations.

## Tutorial:

In many competitive programming problems, you are required to process a list of numbers and generate a new list based on some transformation of adjacent elements. For instance, you may need to compute the sum, product, difference, or any other operation involving consecutive elements.

The general approach is:

1. Iterate through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element.
2. For each index `i`, compute the result using `list[i]` and `list[i+1]`.
3. Append the result to a new list.
4. Return the new list.

This is a linear time operation, O(N), where N is the length of the input list.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Product of Adjacent Elements**

**Problem Description:** Given a list of integers, return a new list where each element is the product of adjacent elements.

**Solution:** Traverse the list from index 0 to N-2, multiply each element with the next one, and store the result in a new list.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def product_of_adjacent(test_tup):
    return [test_tup[i] * test_tup[i+1] for i in range(len(test_tup)-1)]
```

---

### 2. **Sum of Adjacent Elements**

**Problem Description:** Given a list of integers, return a new list where each element is the sum of adjacent elements.

**Solution:** Traverse the list and for each index `i`, compute the sum of `list[i] + list[i+1]`.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def sum_of_adjacent(test_tup):
    return [test_tup[i] + test_tup[i+1] for i in range(len(test_tup)-1)]
```

---

### 3. **Difference of Adjacent Elements**

**Problem Description:** Given a list of integers, return a new list where each element is the absolute difference of adjacent elements.

**Solution:** Traverse the list and compute the absolute difference between consecutive elements.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def difference_of_adjacent(test_tup):
    return [abs(test_tup[i] - test_tup[i+1]) for i in range(len(test_tup)-1)]
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:

The original problem requires taking a list of integers and returning a new list where the i-th element is the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input list.

This can be done efficiently by iterating from index `0` to `len(test_tup) - 2`, and for each index, multiply the current element with the next one. We can use a list comprehension for a concise and efficient solution.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:
```python
from typing import List, Any

def multiply_elements(test_tup: List[int]) -> List[Any]:
    """
    Write a function that takes as input a list of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a list of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The problem involves finding the **left insertion point** for a given value in a **sorted list**. This is a classic use case for the **binary search algorithm**. The key concept here is to find the first position where the element can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. This is also known as the **bisect_left** function in Python's `bisect` module.

## Tutorial:
The **binary search algorithm** is used to find the position of a target value within a sorted list. The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. The key idea is that if the list is sorted, we can compare the target value with the middle element and decide which half of the list to continue searching in.

For the **left insertion point**, we want to find the **first index** where the element can be inserted such that the list remains sorted. This is different from a standard binary search, which finds the exact position of the element. Instead, if the element is not found, the insertion point is the index where the element would be inserted to maintain order.

The `bisect_left` function in Python's `bisect` module does exactly this. It returns the insertion point for `x` in a sorted list `a`, assuming that `a` is sorted in ascending order.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **LeetCode 35: Search Insert Position**
**Problem Description**: Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the **index** where the target is **inserted** to maintain the sorted order. If the target exists in the array, return the index.

**Solution**: Use binary search to find the left insertion point. This is a direct application of `bisect_left`.

```python
import bisect

def searchInsert(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:
    return bisect.bisect_left(nums, target)
```

### 2. **Codeforces 110A: Nearly Lucky Number**
**Problem Description**: A number is considered nearly lucky if the number of digits that are even is a lucky number (i.e., consists only of digits 4 and 7). Check if a number is nearly lucky.

**Solution**: While not directly a binary search problem, this problem can involve sorting and using binary search to count even digits efficiently.

### 3. **AtCoder 158B: Banned String**
**Problem Description**: Given a string `S` and a string `T`, determine if `T` is a substring of `S` after removing any number of characters from `S`.

**Solution**: This is more of a string matching problem, but binary search can be used in certain optimized approaches when dealing with large strings and multiple queries.

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We are to implement a function `left_insertion` that finds the **left insertion point** for a value `x` in a sorted list `a`. This is equivalent to the `bisect_left` function in Python. We can use a binary search algorithm to find the position where `x` would be inserted to keep the list sorted.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:
```python
from typing import List

def left_insertion(a: List[int], x: int) -> int:
    """
    Find the left insertion point for x in a sorted list a.
    """
    low, high = 0, len(a)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if a[mid] < x:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low
```

### Example Usage:
```python
print(left_insertion([1, 3, 5, 7], 4))  # Output: 2
print(left_insertion([1, 3, 5, 7], 5))  # Output: 2
print(left_insertion([1, 3, 5, 7], 8))  # Output: 4

## Algorithms:

The core concept for solving this problem is **sorting** and **comparing elements**. The function needs to find the maximum difference between elements in a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers. The approach involves sorting the list of tuples based on the first element of the tuple, and then calculating the difference between the first elements of consecutive tuples to find the maximum difference.

This problem is similar to finding the maximum difference between elements in a sorted array, which is a common technique in competitive programming.

## Tutorial:

The idea is to sort the list of tuples based on the first element of each tuple. Once sorted, we can iterate through the list and calculate the difference between the first elements of consecutive tuples. The largest of these differences is the result.

Steps:
1. Sort the list of tuples by the first element of each tuple.
2. Initialize a variable to store the maximum difference.
3. Iterate through the sorted list, and for each pair of consecutive tuples, calculate the difference between their first elements.
4. Update the maximum difference if the current difference is larger.
5. Return the maximum difference.

This approach is efficient and has a time complexity of O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Maximum Difference in a List (LeetCode 121)
**Problem Description:**
Given an array of integers `prices`, where `prices[i]` is the price of a stock on day `i`, find the maximum profit from buying on one day and selling on another day (after the buying day). If no profit is possible, return 0.

**Solution:**
- We can iterate through the list, keeping track of the minimum price seen so far.
- For each price, calculate the profit if we sold on that day.
- Update the maximum profit accordingly.

**Python Code:**
```python
def maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:
    min_price = float('inf')
    max_profit = 0
    for price in prices:
        if price < min_price:
            min_price = price
        else:
            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)
    return max_profit
```

### Problem 2: Maximum Difference Between Two Elements (LeetCode 1438)
**Problem Description:**
Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum difference between any two elements such that the index of the smaller element is less than the index of the larger element.

**Solution:**
- Keep track of the minimum value seen so far as you iterate through the array.
- For each element, calculate the difference between the current element and the minimum value so far.
- Update the maximum difference accordingly.

**Python Code:**
```python
def findMaxDifference(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    min_so_far = nums[0]
    max_diff = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        max_diff = max(max_diff, nums[i] - min_so_far)
        min_so_far = min(min_so_far, nums[i])
    return max_diff
```

### Problem 3: Maximum Difference in a Sorted Array (LeetCode 164)
**Problem Description:**
Given an array of integers, find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, where the elements are in increasing order (i.e., the smaller element comes before the larger one).

**Solution:**
- Sort the array.
- Iterate through the sorted array and find the maximum difference between consecutive elements.

**Python Code:**
```python
def maximumGap(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    nums.sort()
    max_gap = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        max_gap = max(max_gap, nums[i] - nums[i-1])
    return max_gap
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- The function `max_difference` takes a list of tuples as input.
- We sort the list of tuples by the first element of each tuple.
- Then, we iterate through the sorted list and compute the difference between the first elements of consecutive tuples.
- We keep track of the maximum difference and return it.

### Python3 code:

    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the maximum difference
    for i in range(1, len(test_list)):
        diff = test_list[i][0] - test_list[i-1][0]
        max_diff = max(max_diff, diff)
    
    return max_diff

## Algorithms:

The core concept in this problem is **simple arithmetic transformation**. The function is expected to convert a human's age into a dog's age, which typically follows a standard conversion rule: the first two years of a dog's life count as 10.5 human years each, and each additional year counts as 4 human years. This is a basic conditional logic and arithmetic problem.

## Tutorial:

In competitive programming, problems often require converting values between different scales or applying conditional logic. For example, in this dog age problem, the conversion depends on whether the human age is less than or equal to 2, or greater than 2. The solution involves:

1. **Input handling**: Taking an integer representing human age.
2. **Conditional logic**: Using if-else to determine which conversion formula to apply.
3. **Arithmetic operations**: Multiplying and adding to get the dog's age.

This kind of problem tests the ability to implement simple logic correctly and efficiently.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Convert Human Years to Dog Years (Similar to original problem)

**Problem Description**: Write a function that converts a human's age to a dog's age. The first two years count as 10.5 dog years each, and every year after that counts as 4 dog years.

**Solution**: Use conditional logic to determine which formula to apply.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def dog_age(h_age: int) -> int:
    if h_age <= 2:
        return int(h_age * 10.5)

**Python3 Code**:

def seconds_to_time(seconds: int) -> str:
    minutes = seconds // 60
    remaining_seconds = seconds % 60
    return f"{minutes} minutes and {remaining_seconds} seconds"

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def celsius_to_fahrenheit(c: float) -> float:
    return (c * 9/5) + 32
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:

The function `dog_age` takes an integer `h_age` representing the human age. It calculates the equivalent dog age using the following logic:
- If the human age is 2 or less, the dog age is `h_age * 10.5`.
- If the human age is more than 2, the dog age is `21 + (h_age - 2) * 4`.

We convert the result to an integer using `int()` because dog age is typically expressed as an integer.

    """
    Write a function to calculate a dog's age in dog years.

## Algorithms:

The core concept of this problem is **element-wise operations on tuples**. This involves iterating over the elements of two tuples of the same length and performing a specific operation (in this case, subtraction) on corresponding elements.

This is a basic application of **tuple unpacking** and **looping through elements**.

## Tutorial:

In Python, tuples are immutable sequences that can be used to store multiple values. When you have two tuples of the same length, you can perform element-wise operations by iterating through them with a loop or using the `zip` function.

For example, if you have two tuples:

```python
tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
tup2 = (4, 5, 6)
```

You can subtract them element-wise like this:

```python
result = tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This uses a **generator expression** inside `tuple()` to create a new tuple with the results of the subtraction.

This technique is useful in many competitive programming problems where you need to perform arithmetic operations on multiple elements in parallel.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Element-wise Sum of Two Tuples**

**Problem Description:**  
You are given two tuples of the same length. Return a new tuple where each element is the sum of the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

**Solution:**  
Use the `zip` function to pair up the elements and then compute the sum for each pair.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def add_elements(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a + b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

---

### 2. **Multiply Tuples Element-Wise**

**Problem Description:**  
Given two tuples of integers, return a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the two input tuples.

**Solution:**  
Use `zip` and a generator expression to multiply corresponding elements.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def multiply_elements(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

---

### 3. **Check for Equality of Tuples Element-Wise**

**Problem Description:**  
Given two tuples of the same length, return a new tuple of booleans indicating whether each corresponding pair of elements is equal.

**Solution:**  
Use `zip` and a generator expression to compare corresponding elements.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def check_equality(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a == b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The problem requires subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the first, element-wise. We can achieve this by using the `zip` function to pair the elements of the two tuples and then subtracting them in a generator expression.

### Python3 code:
```python
from typing import Tuple

def substract_elements(test_tup1: Tuple[int, int, int], test_tup2: Tuple[int, int, int]) -> Tuple[int, int, int]:
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(test_tup1, test_tup2))

- **String manipulation**: Iterating through each character in the string.
- **ASCII values**: Using the `ord()` function to get the ASCII value of a character.
- **Modulo operation**: Applying the modulo 26 operation to the sum of ASCII values to find the required character.
- **Character conversion**: Converting the resulting number back to a character using `chr()`.

## Tutorial:
In this problem, we are given a string and we are to find a character that is derived from the sum of the ASCII values of all the characters in the string, taken modulo 26.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize a sum variable** to 0.
2. **Iterate through each character** in the string.
3. **Add the ASCII value** of the character to the sum using `ord(char)`.
4. **Compute the sum modulo 26** to get a value between 0 and 25.
5. **Convert the result back to a character** using `chr(result + ord('A'))` if we want uppercase letters, or `chr(result + ord('a'))` for lowercase.

This technique is useful in problems where you need to map a number to a character, especially in problems involving cyclic or modular arithmetic.

## Example Problems:

### Example Problem 1: "Character Shift"
**Problem Description:**  
Given a string, shift each character by a certain number (modulo 26) and return the new string.

**Solution:**  
For each character, compute the new ASCII value by shifting it by a certain number, then take modulo 26 to ensure it wraps around the alphabet. Use `ord()` and `chr()` to convert between characters and ASCII values.

**Python Code:**
```python
def shift_char(s: str, shift: int) -> str:
    result = ""
    for char in s:
        if char.isalpha():
            base = ord('A') if char.isupper() else ord('a')
            shifted = (ord(char) - base + shift) % 26 + base
            result += chr(shifted)
        else:
            result += char
    return result
```

### Example Problem 2: "Sum of ASCII Values"
**Problem Description:**  
Given a string, compute the sum of the ASCII values of all the characters.

**Solution:**  
Iterate through the string, sum up the ASCII values using `ord(char)`.

**Python Code:**
```python
def sum_ascii(s: str) -> int:
    return sum(ord(char) for char in s)
```

### Example Problem 3: "Modular Character"
**Problem Description:**  
Given a string, compute a character based on the sum of ASCII values modulo 26.

**Solution:**  
Sum the ASCII values and take modulo 26, then convert the result to a character (e.g., 'A' for 0, 'B' for 1, etc.).

**Python Code:**
```python
def get_char(s: str) -> str:
    total = sum(ord(char) for char in s)
    return chr((total % 26) + ord('A'))
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
1. We iterate through each character in the input string.
2. We calculate the sum of the ASCII values of all characters.
3. We take the sum modulo 26 to get a value between 0 and 25.
4. We convert this value to a character by adding it to the ASCII value of 'A' (for uppercase characters).

### Python3 code:
```python
def get_Char(strr: str) -> str:
    total = sum(ord(char) for char in strr)
    return chr((total % 26) + ord('A'))
```

## Algorithms:
The core concept for solving this problem is **string searching** or **substring checking**. The problem involves checking whether a given substring exists within any of the strings in a list. This is typically done using a simple loop and the `in` operator in Python, which checks for substring presence.

This is a basic string operation and does not require advanced algorithms like KMP or Rabin-Karp, which are more suitable for large-scale or performance-critical applications.

---

## Tutorial:
In Python, checking if a substring exists in a string is straightforward using the `in` keyword. For example:

```python
if "abc" in "abcde":
    print("Found")
```

In the given problem, we have a list of strings (`str1`) and a substring (`sub_str`). The goal is to check if `sub_str` is a substring of **any** of the strings in the list.

The approach is simple:
1. Iterate through each string in the list.
2. For each string, check if `sub_str` is a substring using the `in` operator.
3. If found, return `True`.
4. If none of the strings contain the substring, return `False`.

This is a linear time complexity solution, O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in the list and m is the average length of the strings. However, since it's a simple and efficient enough approach for most practical cases, it is commonly used.

- **Problem Description:** Return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or -1 if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

- **Python Code:**
```python
def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    if not needle:
        return 0
    if len(needle) > len(haystack):
        return -1
    for i in range(len(haystack) - len(needle) + 1):

    return -1

    sum_first = sum(int(c) for c in s[:half])
    sum_second = sum(int(c) for c in s[half:])
    return sum_first == sum_second
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `find_substring` takes a list of strings (`str1`) and a substring (`sub_str`). It iterates through each string in the list and checks if `sub_str` is a substring of the current string using the `in` operator. If found, it returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding the substring, it returns `False`.

## Algorithms:
The problem of finding the next smallest palindrome involves the following core concepts:

1. **Palindrome Check**: A number is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward.
2. **Increment and Check**: The next smallest palindrome can be found by incrementing the number and checking if it's a palindrome.
3. **Mirror the Left Half**: A more efficient approach involves creating a palindrome by mirroring the left half of the number.
4. **Edge Cases**: Handling special cases like numbers with all 9s (e.g., 999 ¡ú 1001).

## Tutorial:

To find the next smallest palindrome of a number:

### Step-by-step Approach:

1. **Convert the number to a string** to easily manipulate its digits.
2. **Check if the number is already a palindrome**. If it is, return the next number (e.g., 121 ¡ú 131).
3. **If the number is not a palindrome**, generate the next possible palindrome by:
   - Creating a mirror of the left half of the number.
   - Incrementing the middle digit if necessary.
   - Handling cases where the number has all 9s.
4. **Return the result** as an integer.

For example:
- Input: 123
- Generate the palindrome by mirroring the left half: 121 ¡ú 131 (next possible palindrome).
- If the number is 999, the next palindrome is 1001.

This approach is efficient and avoids checking every number sequentially, which is especially important for large inputs.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Next Palindrome (Codeforces - 110A)**
**Problem**: Given a number, find the next palindrome greater than it.

**Solution**:
- Convert the number to a string.
- Create a palindrome by mirroring the left half.
- If the generated palindrome is less than the original, increment the middle part.
- Handle the case where all digits are 9 (e.g., 999 ¡ú 1001).

```python
def next_palindrome(n):
    s = str(n)
    l = len(s)
    if all(c == '9' for c in s):
        return int('1' + '0' * (l-1) + '1')
    
    left = s[: (l + 1) // 2]
    left_num = int(left)
    left_pal = str(left_num)
    
    if l % 2 == 0:
        right_pal = left_pal[::-1]
    else:
        right_pal = left_pal[:-1][::-1]
    
    candidate = int(left_pal + right_pal)
    
    if candidate > n:
        return candidate
    else:
        left_num += 1
        left_pal = str(left_num)
        if l % 2 == 0:
            right_pal = left_pal[::-1]
        else:
            right_pal = left_pal[:-1][::-1]
        return int(left_pal + right_pal)

# Example usage
print(next_palindrome(123))  # Output: 131
```

---

### 2. **Palindrome Number (LeetCode - 9)**
**Problem**: Determine if a number is a palindrome.

**Solution**:
- Convert the number to a string and compare it with its reverse.

```python
def is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]

# Example usage
print(is_palindrome(121))  # Output: True
```

---

### 3. **Largest Palindrome from Product of Two n-Digit Numbers (Project Euler - 4)**
**Problem**: Find the largest palindrome that is a product of two n-digit numbers.

**Solution**:
- Iterate through all possible products of two n-digit numbers.
- Check if the product is a palindrome.
- Keep track of the largest one found.

```python
def largest_palindrome(n):
    lower = 10**(n-1)
    upper = 10**n - 1
    max_pal = 0
    for i in range(upper, lower - 1, -1):
        for j in range(i, lower - 1, -1):
            product = i * j
            if str(product) == str(product)[::-1]:
                if product > max_pal:
                    max_pal = product
    return max_pal

# Example usage
print(largest_palindrome(2))  # Output: 9009
```

---

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
- Convert the number to a string to work with digits.
- Check if all digits are 9. If yes, return a number like `100...001`.
- Generate a palindrome by mirroring the left half.
- If the generated palindrome is less than the original number, increment the middle part and mirror again.
- Return the resulting number as an integer.

### Python3 code:
```python
def next_smallest_palindrome(num: int) -> int:
    s = str(num)
    l = len(s)

## Algorithms:
The core concept used in this problem is **element-wise operations on lists**. Specifically, we are performing **subtraction** on corresponding elements of two lists. This is a basic operation in Python that can be done using list comprehensions or loops.

The algorithm involves:
- Iterating over both lists simultaneously.
- Subtracting the corresponding elements.
- Storing the result in a new list.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, it's common to perform operations on lists such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc., element-wise. This is especially useful when working with arrays or vectors.

To perform element-wise subtraction between two lists:
- Ensure both lists have the same length (if not, we may need to handle that, but in this problem, we'll assume they are of the same length).
- Use a loop or list comprehension to subtract each element of the second list from the corresponding element of the first list.

For example:
```python
nums1 = [10, 20, 30]
nums2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = [a - b for a, b in zip(nums1, nums2)]  # [9, 18, 27]
```

This is efficient and concise, and it leverages Python's `zip()` function to pair elements from both lists.

## Example Problems:

### 1. LeetCode 1480. Running Sum of 1d Array
**Problem Description:**
Given an array `nums`, return the running sum of the array where `running_sum[i] = sum(nums[0]...nums[i])`.

**Solution:**
We can solve this by iterating through the list and maintaining a cumulative sum. This is a simple example of a prefix sum, which is similar to element-wise operations.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def runningSum(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    result = []
    total = 0
    for num in nums:
        total += num
        result.append(total)
    return result
```

### 2. LeetCode 1441. Build an Array with Stack Operations
**Problem Description:**
Given a target array and a value `n`, simulate the stack operations to build the target array using the numbers from `1` to `n`.

**Solution:**
This problem uses basic list operations and simulates a stack, but it also involves checking elements in order, which is a form of element-wise comparison.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def buildArray(target: List[int], n: int) -> List[str]:
    result = []
    current = 1
    for num in target:
        while current < num:
            result.append("Push")
            result.append("Pop")
            current += 1
        result.append("Push")
        current += 1
    return result
```

### 3. LeetCode 1385. Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays
**Problem Description:**
Given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, find the number of elements in `arr1` such that for all elements in `arr2`, the absolute difference is greater than a given value `d`.

**Solution:**
This involves checking each element of `arr1` against all elements of `arr2`, which is a form of element-wise comparison and subtraction.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def findTheDistanceValue(arr1: List[int], arr2: List[int], d: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for x in arr1:
        valid = True
        for y in arr2:
            if abs(x - y) <= d:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1
    return count
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We are given two lists `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length. We need to return a new list where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element in `nums2` from `nums1`.

We use Python's `zip()` function to pair elements from both lists, and a list comprehension to perform the subtraction.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The core concept of the problem is **array traversal** and **index-based condition checking**. We need to iterate through the list and check if the number at each even index is even.

This involves:
- Iterating through the list using a loop.
- Checking the index and the value at that index.
- Using a conditional to validate the condition.

## Tutorial:
In competitive programming, checking conditions based on the index of elements in a list is a common task. For example, you might need to check whether elements at even positions meet a certain condition, such as being even, odd, divisible by a number, etc.

To solve such problems:
1. Loop through the list using a range that covers all indices.
2. For each index, check if it is even.
3. If it is, check the value at that index.
4. If any even index contains an odd number, return False.
5. If all even indices meet the condition, return True.

This is a straightforward approach and works efficiently for small to medium-sized lists.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Check if all even indices contain even numbers (similar to the original problem)
**Problem Description**: Given a list of integers, check whether every element at an even index is even.

**Solution**: Traverse the list, check each even index, and verify if the number is even.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def even_position(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
        if nums[i] % 2 != 0:
            return False
    return True
```

---

### Problem 2: Check if all odd indices contain odd numbers
**Problem Description**: Given a list of integers, check whether every element at an odd index is odd.

**Solution**: Traverse the list, check each odd index, and verify if the number is odd.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def odd_position(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    for i in range(1, len(nums), 2):
        if nums[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

---

### Problem 3: Check if all even indices contain numbers divisible by 3
**Problem Description**: Given a list of integers, check whether every element at an even index is divisible by 3.

**Solution**: Traverse the list, check each even index, and verify if the number is divisible by 3.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def divisible_by_three(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    for i in range(0, len(nums), 2):
        if nums[i] % 3 != 0:
            return False
    return True
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We need to check if every element at an even index in the given list is even. To do this, we iterate through the list using a loop with a step of 2 (to only visit even indices). For each such index, we check if the number is even. If any even index contains an odd number, we return `False`. If all even indices meet the condition, we return `True`.

### Python3 code:

from typing import List

def even_position(nums: List[int]) -> bool:

    Check whether every even index contains even numbers in the given list.

Include the following points in your response: 
- Explanation of the solution: 
- Python3 code to solve the problem (inside ```  ``` block):
## Algorithms:
The problem involves string manipulation and pattern recognition. The core concept is to identify the snake case format (lowercase letters with underscores) and convert it to camel case (lowercase letters with no underscores, and the first letter of each word after the first is capitalized).

This is typically done using string splitting and capitalization techniques.

## Tutorial:
In snake case, words are separated by underscores (`_`), and all letters are lowercase. In camel case, the first word is lowercase, and each subsequent word starts with an uppercase letter, with no underscores.

To convert from snake case to camel case:
1. Split the string by the underscore (`_`) character.
2. Take the first word as is (lowercase).
3. Capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word.
4. Concatenate all the words together.

This is a common task in programming contests and real-world applications, such as converting variable names or API responses.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Convert Snake Case to Camel Case (Similar to the original problem)
**Description:** Given a string in snake case, convert it to camel case.

**Solution:** Split the string by `_`, capitalize the first letter of each part except the first, and join them.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def snake_to_camel(word: str) -> str:
    parts = word.split('_')
    return parts[0] + ''.join(part.capitalize() for part in parts[1:])

### Problem 2: Convert Camel Case to Snake Case
**Description:** Convert a camel case string to snake case (e.g., "camelCase" ¡ú "camel_case").

**Solution:** Iterate through each character, and when an uppercase letter is found, insert an underscore before it and convert the letter to lowercase.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def camel_to_snake(word: str) -> str:
    result = []
    for char in word:
        if char.isupper():
            result.append('_')
            result.append(char.lower())
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Problem 3: Convert Pascal Case to Snake Case
**Description:** Convert a pascal case string (e.g., "PascalCase") to snake case ("pascal_case").

**Solution:** Similar to camel case to snake case, but the first character is also capitalized, so we need to handle that.

**Python3 Code:**
```python
def pascal_to_snake(word: str) -> str:
    result = []
    for i, char in enumerate(word):
        if char.isupper():
            if i > 0:
                result.append('_')
            result.append(char.lower())
        else:
            result.append(char)
    return ''.join(result)
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
The function `snake_to_camel` takes a snake case string as input. It splits the string using the underscore (`_`) as a delimiter. The first part of the split string is kept as is, and all subsequent parts are capitalized and concatenated to form the camel case string.

### Python3 code to solve the problem:
```python
def snake_to_camel(word: str) -> str:
    """
    Convert the given snake case string to camel case string.
    """
    parts = word.split('_')
    return parts[0] + ''.join(part.capitalize() for part in parts[1:])
```

## Algorithms:

The core concept for this problem is **index-based comparison** and **common element detection**. The problem requires checking for elements that are **present at the same index** in all three lists. This is not about checking for the presence of an element in all lists (like a set intersection), but rather checking whether the same **index** has the same value across all three lists.

Key algorithms or concepts:
- **Index iteration**: Loop through the indices of the lists.
- **Comparison**: At each index, compare the elements from the three lists.
- **Collecting results**: If the elements at a given index are the same across all three lists, add that element to the result.

## Tutorial:

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through the indices of the three lists. The key point is that the lists may not be of the same length. So, we should iterate only up to the length of the shortest list.

At each index `i`, we check if `l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]`. If they are equal, we add `l1[i]` (or any of the elements, since they are the same) to the result list.

This is a simple but important concept in competitive programming: **index-wise comparison**. It is used in problems like finding common elements at the same position, or checking for symmetry in matrices, etc.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Common Elements at Same Index
**Problem Description**: Given three lists of integers, find all elements that appear at the same index in all three lists.

**Solution**: Iterate through the indices of the lists, and for each index, check if the elements are the same across all three lists. If so, add the element to the result.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def common_elements_at_same_index(l1, l2, l3):
    result = []
    min_len = min(len(l1), len(l2), len(l3))
    for i in range(min_len):
        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:
            result.append(l1[i])
    return result
```

### Problem 2: Check for Same Element at Corresponding Indices
**Problem Description**: Given two lists of the same length, determine whether they have the same element at every index.

**Solution**: Iterate through the indices and compare the elements. If any pair of elements differ, return `False`. Otherwise, return `True`.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def same_elements_at_indices(l1, l2):
    for i in range(len(l1)):
        if l1[i] != l2[i]:
            return False
    return True
```

### Problem 3: Find Common Elements at Same Index in 3 Lists
**Problem Description**: Given three lists of the same length, find all elements that are the same at the same index in all three lists.

**Solution**: Similar to the first problem, iterate through the indices and compare the elements at each index. If they match, add to the result.

**Python3 Code**:
```python
def common_elements_at_same_index_3(l1, l2, l3):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(l1)):
        if l1[i] == l2[i] == l3[i]:
            result.append(l1[i])
    return result
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
We need to iterate through the indices of the three lists. At each index, check if the elements from all three lists are the same. If they are, we add the element to the result list. We only iterate up to the length of the shortest list to avoid index errors.

### Python3 code:

## Algorithms:

The problem requires reversing a number and performing arithmetic operations. The core concepts involved are:

1. **Reversing a Number**: This involves taking a number and reversing its digits.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Performing operations like doubling and subtraction.
3. **String Manipulation**: Often used to reverse the digits of a number by converting it to a string, reversing the string, and converting it back to an integer.

## Tutorial:

To solve this problem, you need to reverse the digits of a number. For example, if the number is 123, the reverse is 321. Here's how you can do it in Python:

### Reversing a Number:
- Convert the number to a string.
- Reverse the string.
- Convert it back to an integer.

### Example:
```python
def reverse_number(n):
    return int(str(n)[::-1])
```

Once you have the reversed number, you can check if the original number is one less than twice the reversed number. That is, check if `n == 2 * reversed_n - 1`.

This is a simple but powerful approach that can be applied to a variety of similar problems.

## Example Problems:

### Problem 1: Palindrome Number
**Description**: Determine if a number is a palindrome (reads the same backward as forward).

**Solution**: Reverse the number and compare it to the original.

```python
def is_palindrome(n):
    return n == int(str(n)[::-1])
```

### Problem 2: Reverse Digits and Add
**Description**: Reverse the digits of a number and add it to the original. Repeat the process until the result is a palindrome.

**Solution**: Use a loop to reverse and add until the result is a palindrome.

```python
def reverse_and_add(n):
    count = 0
    while True:
        reversed_n = int(str(n)[::-1])
        n += reversed_n
        count += 1
        if str(n) == str(n)[::-1]:
            return count
```

### Problem 3: Sum of Reversed Digits
**Description**: Find the sum of a number and its reversed digits.

**Solution**: Reverse the number and add it to the original.

```python
def sum_with_reverse(n):
    reversed_n = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n + reversed_n
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Reverse the given number.
2. Check if the original number is equal to `2 * reversed_number - 1`.

### Python3 code:
```python
def checks(n: int) -> bool:
    reversed_n = int(str(n)[::-1])
    return n == 2 * reversed_n - 1
```

## Algorithms:
The core concepts involved in solving this problem are:
- **Exponentiation**: Calculating a number raised to a power.
- **Digit Sum Calculation**: Summing the individual digits of a number.
- **String Manipulation**: Converting the result of the exponentiation to a string to process each digit.

## Tutorial:
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Compute `base ** power` which may result in a very large number.
2. Convert the result to a string to iterate over each digit.
3. Convert each character back to an integer and sum them up.

This approach is efficient for small to moderately large exponents. For extremely large exponents, it's important to note that the number could become too large to handle in memory, but for standard programming competition constraints, this method is sufficient.

## Example Problems:

### 1. **Problem: Sum of Digits of a Number (Codeforces #580A)**
**Problem Description**: Given a number, compute the sum of its digits.

**Solution**: Convert the number to a string, iterate over each character, convert it back to an integer, and sum.

```

### 2. **Problem: Power Digit Sum (Project Euler #16)**
**Problem Description**: 2^15 = 32768 and the sum of its digits is 3 + 2 + 7 + 6 + 8 = 26.

**Solution**: Compute 2^1000, convert to string, and sum the digits.

```python
def power_digit_sum(base, exponent):
    number = base ** exponent
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(number))
```

### 3. **Problem: Sum of Digits in a Large Number (LeetCode #2540)**
**Problem Description**: Given a number, compute the sum of its digits.

**Solution**: Similar to the previous examples, convert the number to a string and sum the digits.

```python
def digit_sum(n):
    return sum(int(d) for d in str(n))
```

## Python3 code to solve the original problem:

### Explanation of the solution:
1. Calculate `base ** power` to get the result.
2. Convert the result to a string to access each digit.
3. Iterate over each character in the string, convert it to an integer, and sum all the digits.

### Python3 code:
```python
def power_base_sum(base: int, power: int) -> int:
    """
    Write a function that takes base and power as arguments and calculate the sum of all digits of the base to the specified power.
    """
    result = base ** power
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(result))
