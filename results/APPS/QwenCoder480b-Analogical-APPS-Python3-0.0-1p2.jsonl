(after seeing '!'), count consecutive '?' characters\n- Record the combined length and position\n- Keep track of the maximum length combination from the leftmost position\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters\n**Description**: Find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.\n**Solution**: Use sliding window technique with a set to track characters in current window. Expand window by moving right pointer, shrink when duplicate found.\n```python\ndef lengthOfLongestSubstring(s):\n    char_set = set()\n    left = 0\n    max_length = 0\n    \n    for right in range(len(s)):\n        while s[right] in char_set:\n            char_set.remove(s[left])\n            left += 1\n        char_set.add(s[right])\n        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)\n    \n    return max_length\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Maximum Number of Consecutive 1's\n**Description**: Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1's.\n**Solution**: Linear scan, keep count of current consecutive 1's, update maximum when needed.\n```python\ndef findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums):\n    max_count = 0\n    current_count = 0\n    \n    for num in nums:\n        if num == 1:\n            current_count += 1\n            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)\n        else:\n            current_count = 0\n    \n    return max_count\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Partition Labels\n**Description**: Partition string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part.\n**Solution**: First record last occurrence of each character, then scan again to determine partition boundaries.\n```python\ndef partitionLabels(s):\n    last_occurrence = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(s)}\n    result = []\n    start = 0\n    end = 0\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        end = max(end, last_occurrence[char])\n        if i == end:\n            result.append(end - start + 1)\n            start = end + 1\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1.

The key algorithmic concepts are:\n1. Using regular expressions to detect patterns in text\n2. Case-insensitive pattern matching with case-preserving replacement\n3. Multiple sequential string replacements\n4. Word boundary detection to ensure we only replace whole words\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Regular Expressions (Regex) in Python\n\nRegular expressions are powerful tools for pattern matching and text manipulation. In Python, we use the `re` module.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n1. **Basic Patterns**: `r\"pattern\"` - raw strings are preferred for regex\n2. **Word Boundaries**: `\\b` ensures we match complete words only\n3. **Case Sensitivity**: By default, regex is case-sensitive\n4. **Substitution**: `re.sub(pattern, replacement, string)` replaces matches\n5. **Capturing Groups**: Parentheses `()` capture parts of matches for reference\n6. **Lambda Functions**: Can be used for dynamic replacements\n\n**Useful Regex Symbols:**\n- `\\b` - Word boundary\n- `[Pp]` - Matches either 'P' or 'p'\n- `()` - Capturing group\n- `.*?` - Non-greedy match of any characters\n\nFor this problem, we need to:\n1. Match specific words with word boundaries to avoid partial matches\n2. Handle both lowercase and properly capitalized versions\n3. Preserve the capitalization pattern in our replacements\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Text Editor Find and Replace\n**Description**: Implement a simple text editor's find-and-replace feature that supports case-sensitive and whole-word-only matching.\n\n**Solution**: Use regex with word boundaries and exact case matching.\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef find_replace(text, find_word, replace_word):\n    pattern = r'\\b' + re.escape(find_word) + r'\\b'\n    return re.sub(pattern, replace_word, text)\n\n# Example usage\ntext = \"I love coding. Coding is fun.\"\nresult = find_replace(text, \"coding\", \"programming\")\nprint(result)  # \"I love programming. Coding is fun.\"\n```\n\n### Problem 2: URL Normalization\n**Description**: Convert various URL formats to a standardized form (e.g., \"www.google.com\" \u2192 \"https://google.com\")\n\n**Solution**: Use regex to identify URL patterns and reformat them.\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef normalize_url(url):\n    # Remove www prefix\n    url = re.sub(r'^www\\.', '', url)\n    # Add https:// if missing\n    if not re.match(r'^https?://', url):\n        url = 'https://' + url\n    return url\n\n# Example usage\nurls = [\"www.google.com\", \"http://example.org\", \"github.com\"]\nnormalized = [normalize_url(url) for url in urls]\nprint(normalized)  # ['https://google.com', 'http://example.org', 'https://github.com']\n```\n\n### Problem 3: CamelCase to SnakeCase Converter\n**Description**: Convert CamelCase identifiers to snake_case (e.g., \"camelCaseString\" \u2192 \"camel_case_string\")\n\n**Solution**: Use regex to find uppercase letters and insert underscores before them.\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef camel_to_snake(name):\n    # Insert underscore before uppercase letters that follow lowercase letters\n    s1 = re.sub('(.)([A-Z][a-z]+)', r'\\1_\\2', name)\n    # Insert underscore before uppercase letters that follow lowercase letters/numbers\n    return re.sub('([a-z0-9])([A-Z])', r'\\1_\\2', s1).lower()\n\n# Example usage\nprint(camel_to_snake(\"camelCaseString\"))  # \"camel_case_string\"\nprint(camel_to_snake(\"XMLHttpRequest\"))   # \"xml_http_request\"\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. We import the `re` module for regex operations\n2. Define the `gymSlang` function that takes a string input\n3. For each replacement rule, we create a regex pattern with word boundaries (`\\b`) to match complete words only\n4. We use character classes like `[Pp]` to match both lowercase and capitalized versions\n5. We use `re.sub()` to perform the replacements, preserving the original capitalization pattern\n6. For multi-word phrases like \"i am\" and \"do not\", we handle spaces appropriately in our patterns\n7. Finally, we read input from stdin, call the function, and print the result\n\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef gymSlang(phrase):\n    # Replace \"probably\" -> \"prolly\" (case insensitive)\n    phrase = re.sub(r'\\b[Pp]robably\\b', lambda m: \"Prolly\" if m.group().istitle() else \"prolly\", phrase)\n    \n    # Replace \"i am\" -> \"i'm\" (case insensitive)\n    phrase = re.sub(r'\\b[Ii]\\s+[Aa]m\\b', lambda m: \"I'm\" if m.group()[0].isupper() else \"i'm\", phrase)\n    \n    # Replace \"instagram\" -> \"insta\" (case insensitive)\n    phrase = re.sub(r'\\b[Ii]nstagram\\b', lambda m: \"Insta\" if m.group().istitle() else \"insta\", phrase)\n    \n    # Replace \"do not\" -> \"don't\" (case insensitive)\n    phrase = re.sub(r'\\b[Dd]o\\s+[Nn]ot\\b', lambda m: \"Don't\" if m.group()[0].isupper() else \"don't\", phrase)\n    \n    # Replace \"going to\" -> \"gonna\" (case insensitive)\n    phrase = re.sub(r'\\b[Gg]oing\\s+[Tt]o\\b', lambda m: \"Gonna\" if m.group()[0].isupper() else \"gonna\", phrase)\n    \n    # Replace \"combination\" -> \"combo\" (case insensitive)\n    phrase = re.sub(r'\\b[Cc]ombination\\b', lambda m: \"Combo\" if m.group().istitle() else \"combo\", phrase)\n    \n    return phrase\n\n# Read input and process\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    input_phrase = input()\n    result = gymSlang(input_phrase)\n    print(result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [725], "completion_tokens": [1347], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3884}

The key steps are:\n\n1. **Index-aware iteration**: Use enumeration or manual indexing to access both element values and their positions\n2. **Divisibility check**: For each element at index `i`, check if `element % i == 0` (with special handling for index 0)\n3. **Filtering**: Collect elements that satisfy the condition into a result array\n\n**Important considerations:**\n- Index 0 requires special handling since division by zero is undefined\n- Negative numbers: In Python, `%` operator works correctly with negative numbers for divisibility checks\n- Time complexity: O(n) where n is array length\n- Space complexity: O(k) where k is the number of matching elements\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Filter Even Position Elements\n**Description**: Given an array, return elements at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n**Solution**: Iterate through the array and collect elements where index % 2 == 0.\n\n```python\ndef even_position_elements(arr):\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            result.append(arr[i])\n    return result\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Divisible Pairs Count\n**Description**: Count how many pairs (i,j) exist where i < j and arr[i] is divisible by arr[j].\n\n**Solution**: Use nested loops to check all pairs and count those satisfying the divisibility condition.\n\n```python\ndef count_divisible_pairs(arr):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            if arr[j] != 0 and arr[i] % arr[j] == 0:\n                count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Index Power Sum\n**Description**: For each element, if it's divisible by its index, add index^element to result sum.\n\n**Solution**: Traverse array, check divisibility, and accumulate the power sum for qualifying elements.\n\n```python\ndef index_power_sum(arr):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        if i != 0 and arr[i] % i == 0:\n            total += i ** arr[i]\n    return total\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1.

{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef solve(color):\n    # Mapping of yellow HTML colors to green replacements\n    yellow_to_green = {\n        'gold': 'ForestGreen',\n        'khaki': 'LimeGreen',\n        'lemonchiffon': 'PaleGreen',\n        'lightgoldenrodyellow': 'SpringGreen',\n        'lightyellow': 'MintCream',\n        'palegoldenrod': 'LightGreen',\n        'yellow': 'Lime'\n    }\n    \n    # Check if it's an HTML color name\n    if not color.startswith('#'):\n        color_lower = color.lower()\n        if color_lower in yellow_to_green:\n            return yellow_to_green[color_lower]\n        else:\n            return color\n    \n    # Handle hex color codes\n    else:\n        # Extract R, G, B components\n        r_hex = color[1:3]\n        g_hex = color[3:5]\n        b_hex = color[5:7]\n        \n        # Convert hex to decimal\n        r_val = int(r_hex, 16)\n        g_val = int(g_hex, 16)\n        b_val = int(b_hex, 16)\n        \n        # Check if it's \"too yellow\" (R > B and G > B)\n        if r_val > b_val and g_val > b_val:\n            # Sort the values\n            sorted_vals = sorted([r_val, g_val, b_val])\n            smallest, middle, largest = sorted_vals\n            \n            # Rearrange: smallest->R, middle->B, largest->G\n            new_r = smallest\n            new_g = largest\n            new_b = middle\n            \n            # Convert back to hex, preserving original case format\n            result = \"#\" + format(new_r, '02x') + format(new_g, '02x') + format(new_b, '02x')\n            \n            # Match the case of the original input\n            result_chars = list(result)\n            for i in range(1, 7):  # Only for the hex digits\n                if color[i].isupper():\n                    result_chars[i] = result_chars[i].upper()\n                else:\n                    result_chars[i] = result_chars[i].lower()\n            \n            return ''.join(result_chars)\n        else:\n            return color\n\n# Read input and solve\ncolor = input().strip()\nprint(solve(color))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["# Solution\n\n## Algorithms:\nThis problem involves string manipulation, pattern matching, and conversion between different number systems (hexadecimal to decimal). The key concepts are:\n1. Case-insensitive string comparison and mapping\n2. Parsing and manipulating hexadecimal color codes\n3. Conditional logic based on color component values\n\n## Tutorial:\nWhen working with color values in programming, we often need to:\n1. Handle case-insensitive comparisons by converting strings to a consistent case\n2. Parse hexadecimal values by converting hex digits to decimal integers\n3. Manipulate color components according to specific rules\n4. Maintain original formatting when returning results\n\nFor hex color codes, each pair of characters represents a value from 00 to FF (0-255 in decimal). To convert hex to decimal, we can use Python's built-in `int(hex_string, 16)` function. To sort color components and rearrange them, we can use sorting algorithms and tuple unpacking.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Color Code Converter\n**Description**: Convert between different color representations (RGB, HEX, HSL).\n**Solution**: Parse the input format, extract values, perform necessary conversions, and format output.\n```python\ndef rgb_to_hex(r, g, b):\n    return \"#{:02X}{:02X}{:02X}\".format(r, g, b)\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Validate Hex Color Code\n**Description**: Check if a string is a valid 6-digit hex color code.\n**Solution**: Use regex or manual validation to ensure proper format.\n```python\nimport re\ndef is_valid_hex_color(code):\n    return bool(re.match(r'^#[0-9A-Fa-f]{6}$', code))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Brightness Adjustment\n**Description**: Adjust the brightness of a color by modifying RGB values.\n**Solution**: Parse the color, modify each component proportionally, and return new color.\n```python\ndef adjust_brightness(hex_color, factor):\n    r, g, b = [int(hex_color[i:i+2], 16) for i in (1, 3, 5)]\n    r = min(255, max(0, int(r * factor)))\n    g = min(255, max(0, int(g * factor)))\n    b = min(255, max(0, int(b * factor)))\n    return f\"#{r:02X}{g:02X}{b:02X}\"\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. First, we create a mapping dictionary for HTML color names that need to be replaced\n2.

Here we use:\n- **Rounding to nearest ten**: To round a number to the nearest ten, we can add 5 and then divide by 10, then multiply by 10 again. Alternatively, we can use `(n + 5) // 10 * 10`.\n- **Integer division**: Using `//` to get the floor of a division.\n- **Modulo operation**: Using `%` to get remainders.\n\n### Conditional Logic\nBased on different conditions, we apply different formulas. This is implemented using if-elif-else statements.\n\n### Floor Division\nWhen we need to round down after division, we use floor division (`//`) which automatically truncates toward negative infinity.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Tax Calculation\n**Description**: Calculate tax on purchases with different rates based on item categories.\n**Solution**: Use conditional statements to determine the tax rate, then apply it to the purchase amount.\n```python\ndef calculate_tax(price, category):\n    if category == \"luxury\":\n        tax_rate = 0.1\n    elif category == \"standard\":\n        tax_rate = 0.05\n    else:  # basic\n        tax_rate = 0.02\n    \n    tax = int(price * tax_rate)\n    return price + tax\n\nprice = int(input())\ncategory = input()\nprint(calculate_tax(price, category))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Grade Calculator\n**Description**: Convert numerical scores to letter grades with specific thresholds.\n**Solution**: Use a series of conditionals to check score ranges and assign appropriate grades.\n```python\ndef get_grade(score):\n    if score >= 90:\n        return 'A'\n    elif score >= 80:\n        return 'B'\n    elif score >= 70:\n        return 'C'\n    elif score >= 60:\n        return 'D'\n    else:\n        return 'F'\n\nscore = int(input())\nprint(get_grade(score))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Integer Division Simulator\n**Description**: Implement custom division that always rounds towards zero.\n**Solution**: Check signs of operands and use floor division appropriately.\n```python\ndef div_round_zero(a, b):\n    if (a < 0) ^ (b < 0):  # Different signs\n        return -(-a // b) if a < 0 else -(a // -b)\n    else:  # Same signs\n        return a // b\n\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(div_round_zero(a, b))\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. First, we round the price P to the nearest ten. We do this by adding 5 to P, dividing by 10 (integer division), then multiplying by 10.\n2. Next, we calculate the base tip T by dropping the singles digit from the rounded price. This is done by dividing the rounded price by 10 (integer division).\n3. Finally, we apply the satisfaction rating R:\n   - If R=1 (satisfied): Add 1 to T\n   - If R=0 (unsatisfied): Subtract 1 from T\n   - If R=-1 (appalled): Divide T by 2 (floor division), then subtract 1\n4.

Preserving non-alphabetic characters unchanged\n\nThis is a straightforward transformation problem that requires linear time complexity O(n) where n is the length of the string.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n### String Case Manipulation Basics\n\nIn programming, strings are sequences of characters that can be manipulated in various ways. Character case manipulation is one of the most common string operations.\n\n#### Key Concepts:\n\n1. **Character Classification**: \n   - Uppercase letters: A-Z (ASCII 65-90)\n   - Lowercase letters: a-z (ASCII 97-122)\n   - Numbers and special characters remain unchanged\n\n2. **Case Conversion Methods**:\n   - Most programming languages provide built-in methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `swapcase()`\n   - Manual conversion can be done by manipulating ASCII values (difference of 32 between cases)\n\n3. **Pure Functions**: \n   - Functions that don't modify their input but return a new result\n   - Important for avoiding side effects and maintaining data integrity\n\n#### Implementation Approaches:\n\n1. **Built-in Methods**: Using language-specific string methods\n2. **Manual Character Processing**: Looping through each character and applying transformations\n3. **List Comprehension**: Functional approach for concise code\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Reverse Words in a String\n**Description**: Given a string, reverse the order of words while keeping each word intact.\n**Solution**: Split the string into words, reverse the list of words, then join them back.\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s):\n    return ' '.join(s.split()[::-1])\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Valid Palindrome\n**Description**: Check if a string is a palindrome ignoring case and non-alphanumeric characters.\n**Solution**: Convert to lowercase, filter alphanumeric characters, then check if it reads the same forwards and backwards.\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())\n    return cleaned == cleaned[::-1]\n```\n\n### Problem 3: CamelCase to SnakeCase Conversion\n**Description**: Convert camelCase strings to snake_case format.\n**Solution**: Iterate through characters, insert underscore before uppercase letters (except first), convert to lowercase.\n```python\ndef camel_to_snake(s):\n    result = []\n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if char.isupper() and i > 0:\n            result.append('_')\n        result.append(char.lower())\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe solution involves creating a function that takes a string and returns a new string with alternating case. For each character:\n1. If it's uppercase, convert it to lowercase\n2. If it's lowercase, convert it to uppercase\n3. If it's neither (numbers, symbols), keep it unchanged\n\nWe use Python's built-in string methods `isupper()`, `islower()`, `upper()`, and `lower()` for clean and readable code.
