{"name": "2183", "description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n\nOutput\n25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's illustrate what happens with the first test case.

Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 2 times: we get $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 1 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.

The key idea is to simulate the killing process efficiently by tracking how long each element survives before being killed. We can use a stack to keep track of elements and their \"death times\" to determine when the process stabilizes.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n### Monotonic Stack Concept:\nA monotonic stack is a stack where the elements are either strictly increasing or decreasing. It's particularly useful for problems where we need to find the next greater/smaller element or determine some property based on relative ordering.\n\n### Problem Analysis:\n1. In each step, a psycho kills his right neighbor if his ID > right neighbor's ID\n2. We need to find how many steps until no more killings occur\n3. Key insight: Each element can only be killed by someone to its left, and the time it takes depends on how long it takes for that killer to survive\n\n### Approach:\n1. Use a stack to store pairs of (value, death_time)\n2. For each new element from left to right:\n   - Pop elements from stack that are smaller (will be killed)\n   - Track the maximum death time among popped elements\n   - Current element's death time is max_time + 1 (or 0 if stack is empty)\n3. The answer is the maximum death time across all elements\n\n### Why This Works:\n- When processing an element, any smaller elements to its left that would kill it have already been processed\n- The death time represents how many steps it takes for that element to be eliminated\n- By keeping track of death times, we simulate multiple steps in a single pass\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Next Greater Element\n**Description**: Given an array, find the next greater element for each element (the first element to the right that is greater).\n\n**Solution**: \nUse a monotonic decreasing stack. For each element, pop smaller elements from stack - the current element is their next greater element.\n\n```python\ndef next_greater_element(nums):\n    stack = []\n    result = [-1] * len(nums)\n    \n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] < nums[i]:\n            index = stack.pop()\n            result[index] = nums[i]\n        stack.append(i)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [4, 5, 2, 25]\nprint(next_greater_element(nums))  # [5, 25, 25, -1]\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Largest Rectangle in Histogram\n**Description**: Given heights of bars in a histogram, find the area of the largest rectangle.\n\n**Solution**: \nUse a monotonic increasing stack to find for each bar the nearest smaller bar on left and right. The width of rectangle with current bar as height is determined by these boundaries.\n\n```python\ndef largest_rectangle_area(heights):\n    stack = []\n    max_area = 0\n    heights.append(0)  # Add sentinel\n    \n    for i in range(len(heights)):\n        while stack and heights[stack[-1]] > heights[i]:\n            h = heights[stack.pop()]\n            w = i if not stack else i - stack[-1] - 1\n            max_area = max(max_area, h * w)\n        stack.append(i)\n    \n    return max_area\n\n# Example usage\nheights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]\nprint(largest_rectangle_area(heights))  # 10\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Trapping Rain Water\n**Description**: Given an elevation map, compute how much water it can trap after raining.\n\n**Solution**: \nUse a monotonic stack to find\u51f9\u9677 regions. When we find a bar higher than stack top, we've found a basin that can trap water.\n\n```python\ndef trap(height):\n    stack = []\n    water = 0\n    \n    for i in range(len(height)):\n        while stack and height[stack[-1]] < height[i]:\n            bottom = height[stack.pop()]\n            if not stack:\n                break\n            left = stack[-1]\n            width = i - left - 1\n            water += width * (min(height[left], height[i]) - bottom)\n        stack.append(i)\n    \n    return water\n\n# Example usage\nheight = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]\nprint(trap(height))  # 6\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. We use a stack to simulate the process efficiently\n2. For each psycho from left to right, we determine when they will be killed (their \"death time\")\n3. A psycho dies when encountered by a psycho with higher ID to its left\n4. The number of steps needed is the maximum death time among all psychos\n5. We store pairs of (psycho_id, death_time) in the stack\n6. When processing a new psycho:\n   - Remove all psychos with smaller IDs (they get killed by current psycho)\n   - Track the maximum death time among removed psychos\n   - Current psycho's death time is that maximum + 1 (or 0 if no one was killed)\n7. The answer is the highest death time we've seen\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\npsychos = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\nstack = []  # Each element is (value, death_time)\nmax_steps = 0\n\nfor psycho in psychos:\n    death_time = 0\n    \n    # Remove all psychos with smaller ID (they get killed by current psycho)\n    while stack and stack[-1][0] < psycho:\n        _, prev_death_time = stack.pop()\n        death_time = max(death_time, prev_death_time)\n    \n    # If we removed someone, current psycho dies one step after the latest death\n    if stack:  # There's still someone to the left who might kill current psycho later\n        death_time += 1\n    else:  # No one to the left, this psycho will never be killed\n        death_time = 0\n    \n    stack.append((psycho, death_time))\n    max_steps = max(max_steps, death_time)\n\nprint(max_steps)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [581], "completion_tokens": [1320], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2190}

[Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000)\u00a0\u2014 the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes.

In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p_4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below.

Unfortunately, the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds, and had no time to make an actual test.

Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on, until only one integer remains. The first operation should be addition.\n\nNote that, if she ended the previous row by adding the integers, she should start the next row by subtracting, and vice versa.\n\nThe teachers will simply look at the last integer, and then if it is correct, Karen gets a perfect score, otherwise, she gets a zero for the test.\n\nKaren has studied well for this test, but she is scared that she might make a mistake somewhere and it will cause her final answer to be wrong.

{"name": "2047", "description": "Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 2\n1 0\n0 2\n0 1\n0 2\n", "output": ["7\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 1 1\n2 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "7 14\n2 11 1 14 9 8 5\n12 6 7 1 10 2 3\n14 13 9 8 5 4 11\n13 6 4 3 12 7 10\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "2 1\n0 0\n0 0\n0 1\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "2 3\n0 2\n0 1\n3 2\n3 1\n", "output": ["7\n1 2 1\n2 2 2\n3 4 1\n1 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n", "output": ["2\n1 3 1\n1 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 4\n3 4\n2 1\n3 4\n2 1\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "3 5\n2 1 5\n5 3 2\n4 0 1\n0 4 3\n", "output": ["18\n4 3 2\n5 3 1\n3 2 1\n2 2 2\n1 2 3\n4 4 2\n5 3 2\n3 3 1\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n5 3 3\n3 3 2\n2 1 1\n1 1 2\n5 2 3\n3 3 3\n5 1 3\n3 4 3\n"]}, {"input": "10 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["1\n1 1 3\n"]}, {"input": "50 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["34\n1 3 27\n1 3 28\n1 3 29\n1 3 30\n1 3 31\n1 3 32\n1 3 33\n1 3 34\n1 3 35\n1 3 36\n1 3 37\n1 3 38\n1 3 39\n1 3 40\n1 3 41\n1 3 42\n1 3 43\n1 3 44\n1 3 45\n1 3 46\n1 3 47\n1 3 48\n1 3 49\n1 3 50\n1 2 50\n1 2 49\n1 2 48\n1 2 47\n1 2 46\n1 2 45\n1 2 44\n1 2 43\n1 2 42\n1 1 42\n"]}, {"input": "22 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["65\n2 2 13\n1 3 21\n2 2 12\n1 3 22\n2 2 11\n1 2 22\n2 2 10\n1 2 21\n2 2 9\n1 2 20\n2 2 8\n1 2 19\n2 2 7\n1 2 18\n2 2 6\n1 2 17\n2 2 5\n1 2 16\n2 2 4\n1 2 15\n2 2 3\n1 2 14\n2 2 2\n1 2 13\n2 2 1\n1 2 12\n2 3 1\n1 2 11\n2 3 2\n1 2 10\n2 3 3\n1 2 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 8\n2 3 5\n1 2 7\n2 3 6\n1 2 6\n2 3 7\n1 2 5\n2 3 8\n1 2 4\n2 3 9\n1 2 3\n2 3 10\n1 2 2\n2 3 11\n1 2 1\n2 3 12\n1 3 1\n2 3 13\n1 3 2\n2 3 14\n1 3 3\n2 3 15\n1 3 4\n2 3 16\n1 3 5\n2 3 17\n1 3 6\n2 3 18\n1 3 7\n2 4 18\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "12 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 2 0\n", "output": ["38\n1 3 11\n3 3 7\n2 3 2\n1 3 12\n3 3 8\n2 3 3\n1 2 12\n3 3 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 11\n3 4 9\n2 3 5\n1 2 10\n2 3 6\n1 2 9\n2 3 7\n1 2 8\n2 3 8\n1 2 7\n2 3 9\n1 2 6\n2 3 10\n1 2 5\n2 3 11\n1 2 4\n2 4 11\n1 2 3\n1 2 2\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 3 2\n1 3 3\n1 3 4\n1 3 5\n1 3 6\n1 3 7\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "10 20\n18 9 4 5 12 14 16 1 15 20\n11 13 16 6 18 5 20 17 4 3\n12 9 15 14 8 10 2 19 1 7\n6 11 13 2 7 19 10 3 8 17\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "15 30\n20 24 17 13 26 8 5 6 27 14 18 22 25 2 15\n4 12 6 25 3 5 28 11 15 21 9 26 7 17 13\n19 20 24 16 2 23 8 29 22 30 1 27 10 14 18\n9 29 3 7 12 28 10 16 23 19 21 1 30 11 4\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": [""], "responses": ["Request timed out."], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2047}
{"name": "2026", "description": "Yaroslav is playing a game called \"Time\". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time.

Otherwise, Boboniu won't do anything. \n\nThe total fun factor is the sum of the fun factors on the days when Du can speak.\n\nDu asked you to find the maximum total fun factor among all possible permutations of $a$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $d$ and $m$ ($1\\le d\\le n\\le 10^5,0\\le m\\le 10^9$).\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n$ ($0\\le a_i\\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer: the maximum total fun factor among all permutations of $a$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 11\n8 10 15 23 5\n\nOutput\n48\n\nInput\n20 2 16\n20 5 8 2 18 16 2 16 16 1 5 16 2 13 6 16 4 17 21 7\n\nOutput\n195\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you can set $a'=[15, 5, 8, 10, 23]$.

{"name": "2159", "description": "Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 T, 1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 1000) each \u2014 the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests. The blue circles represent the questions, the two arrows that go from every circle represent where a person goes depending on his answer to that question. The tasks are the red ovals.

{"name": "2066", "description": "In the official contest this problem has a different statement, for which jury's solution was working incorrectly, and for this reason it was excluded from the contest. This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n - 2). After that Vova's character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.\n\nVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line on the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, n is even)\u00a0\u2014 the number of positions available initially. The second line contains n distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9), giving the coordinates of the corresponding positions.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the distance between the warrior and the archer at the beginning of the fight, provided that both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n0 1 3 7 15 31\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n2\n73 37\n\nOutput\n36\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample one of the optimum behavior of the players looks like that:  Vova bans the position at coordinate 15;  Lesha bans the position at coordinate 3;  Vova bans the position at coordinate 31;  Lesha bans the position at coordinate 1. \n\nAfter these actions only positions 0 and 7 will remain, and the distance between them is equal to 7.\n\nIn the second sample there are only two possible positions, so there will be no bans.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2066, "sample_io": [{"input": "6\n0 1 3 7 15 31\n", "output": ["7\n"]}, {"input": "2\n73 37\n", "output": ["36\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "6\n0 1 3 7 15 31\n", "output": ["7\n"]}, {"input": "2\n73 37\n", "output": ["36\n"]}, {"input": "2\n0 1000000000\n", "output": ["1000000000\n"]}, {"input": "8\n729541013 135019377 88372488 319157478 682081360 558614617 258129110 790518782\n", "output": ["470242129\n"]}, {"input": "2\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "8\n552283832 997699491 89302459 301640204 288141798 31112026 710831619 862166501\n", "output": ["521171806\n"]}, {"input": "4\n0 500000000 500000001 1000000000\n", "output": ["500000000\n"]}, {"input": "18\n515925896 832652240 279975694 570998878 28122427 209724246 898414431 709461320 358922485 439508829 403574907 358500312 596248410 968234748 187793884 728450713 30350176 528924900\n", "output": ["369950401\n"]}, {"input": "20\n713900269 192811911 592111899 609607891 585084800 601258511 223103775 876894656 751583891 230837577 971499807 312977833 344314550 397998873 558637732 216574673 913028292 762852863 464376621 61315042\n", "output": ["384683838\n"]}, {"input": "10\n805513144 38998401 16228409 266085559 293487744 471510400 138613792 649258082 904651590 244678415\n", "output": ["277259335\n"]}, {"input": "6\n0 166666666 333333333 499999998 666666665 833333330\n", "output": ["499999997\n"]}, {"input": "16\n1 62500001 125000001 187500000 250000000 312500000 375000000 437500001 500000000 562500000 625000000 687500001 750000001 812500002 875000002 937500000\n", "output": ["499999999\n"]}, {"input": "12\n5 83333336 166666669 250000001 333333336 416666670 500000004 583333336 666666667 750000001 833333334 916666671\n", "output": ["499999998\n"]}, {"input": "20\n54 50000046 100000041 150000049 200000061 250000039 300000043 350000054 400000042 450000045 500000076 550000052 600000064 650000065 700000055 750000046 800000044 850000042 900000052 950000054\n", "output": ["499999988\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": [""], "responses": ["'gbk' codec can't encode character '\\xa0' in position 2275: illegal multibyte sequence"], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2066}
{"name": "2104", "description": "Pavel made a photo of his favourite stars in the sky. His camera takes a photo of all points of the sky that belong to some rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nStrictly speaking, it makes a photo of all points with coordinates $(x, y)$, such that $x_1 \\leq x \\leq x_2$ and $y_1 \\leq y \\leq y_2$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are coordinates of the left bottom and the right top corners of the rectangle being photographed. The area of this rectangle can be zero.\n\nAfter taking the photo, Pavel wrote down coordinates of $n$ of his favourite stars which appeared in the photo. These points are not necessarily distinct, there can be multiple stars in the same point of the sky.\n\nPavel has lost his camera recently and wants to buy a similar one. Specifically, he wants to know the dimensions of the photo he took earlier. Unfortunately, the photo is also lost. His notes are also of not much help; numbers are written in random order all over his notepad, so it's impossible to tell which numbers specify coordinates of which points.\n\nPavel asked you to help him to determine what are the possible dimensions of the photo according to his notes. As there are multiple possible answers, find the dimensions with the minimal possible area of the rectangle.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an only integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$), the number of points in Pavel's records.\n\nThe second line contains $2 \\cdot n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_{2 \\cdot n}$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$), coordinates, written by Pavel in some order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer, the minimal area of the rectangle which could have contained all points from Pavel's records.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n3\n5 8 5 5 7 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample stars in Pavel's records can be $(1, 3)$, $(1, 3)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 4)$.
