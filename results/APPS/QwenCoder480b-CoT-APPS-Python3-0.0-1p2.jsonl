Replace *all* instances of ```\"i am\"``` to ```\"i'm\"```\n3. Replace *all* instances of ```\"instagram\"``` to ```\"insta\"```\n4. Replace *all* instances of ```\"do not\"``` to ```\"don't\"```\n5. Replace *all* instances of ```\"going to\"``` to ```\"gonna\"```\n6. Replace *all* instances of ```\"combination\"``` to ```\"combo\"```\n\nYour replacement regexes **should be case-sensitive**, only replacing the words above with slang if the detected pattern is in **lowercase**.  However, please note that apart from 100% lowercase matches, you will **also have to replace matches that are correctly capitalized** (e.g. ```\"Probably\" => \"Prolly\"``` or ```\"Instagram\" => \"Insta\"```).\n\nFinally, your code will be tested to make sure that you have used **RegExp** replace in your code.\n\nEnjoy :D", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3884, "sample_io": [{"input": "Probably", "output": ["Prolly"]}, {"input": "Instagram", "output": ["Insta"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "When I miss few days of gym", "output": ["When I miss few days of gym"]}, {"input": "Squad probably think I am fake", "output": ["Squad prolly think I'm fake"]}, {"input": "Whole squad probably bigger than me now", "output": ["Whole squad prolly bigger than me now"]}, {"input": "No selfie to post on Instagram either", "output": ["No selfie to post on Insta either"]}, {"input": "Gym crush probably found someone else", "output": ["Gym crush prolly found someone else"]}, {"input": "What if I die fat", "output": ["What if I die fat"]}, {"input": "What if I do not fit in my clothes now", "output": ["What if I don't fit in my clothes now"]}, {"input": "Going to feel like a new gym member", "output": ["Gonna feel like a new gym member"]}, {"input": "wait what was my lock combination", "output": ["wait what was my lock combo"]}, {"input": "that skinny girl can probably outlift me now", "output": ["that skinny girl can prolly outlift me now"]}, {"input": "probably Probably", "output": ["prolly Prolly"]}, {"input": "i am I am", "output": ["i'm I'm"]}, {"input": "instagram Instagram", "output": ["insta Insta"]}, {"input": "do not Do not", "output": ["don't Don't"]}, {"input": "going to Going to", "output": ["gonna Gonna"]}, {"input": "combination Combination", "output": ["combo Combo"]}, {"input": "probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably probably Probably", "output": ["prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly prolly Prolly"]}, {"input": "i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am i am I am", "output": ["i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm i'm I'm"]}, {"input": "instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram instagram Instagram", "output": ["insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta insta Insta"]}, {"input": "do not Do not do not Do not do not Do not do not Do not", "output": ["don't Don't don't Don't don't Don't don't Don't"]}, {"input": "Going to going to Going to Going to going to Going to Going to going to Going to", "output": ["Gonna gonna Gonna Gonna gonna Gonna Gonna gonna Gonna"]}, {"input": "combination combination Combination combination Combination", "output": ["combo combo Combo combo Combo"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef gym_slang(phrase):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef gymSlang(phrase):\n    # Define replacement patterns\n    replacements = [\n        (r'\\b(probably)\\b', 'prolly'),\n        (r'\\b(i am)\\b', \"i'm\"),\n        (r'\\b(instagram)\\b', 'insta'),\n        (r'\\b(do not)\\b', \"don't\"),\n        (r'\\b(going to)\\b', 'gonna'),\n        (r'\\b(combination)\\b', 'combo')\n    ]\n    \n    result = phrase\n    \n    # Apply each replacement\n    for pattern, replacement in replacements:\n        # Use a function to handle capitalization\n        def replace_func(match):\n            original = match.group(1)\n            if original[0].isupper():\n                return replacement.capitalize()\n            else:\n                return replacement\n        \n        # Apply the replacement with case sensitivity\n        result = re.sub(pattern, replace_func, result, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input and process\ninput_phrase = input()\noutput_phrase = gymSlang(input_phrase)\nprint(output_phrase)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef gymSlang(phrase):\n    # Define replacement patterns\n    replacements = [\n        (r'\\b(probably)\\b', 'prolly'),\n        (r'\\b(i am)\\b', \"i'm\"),\n        (r'\\b(instagram)\\b', 'insta'),\n        (r'\\b(do not)\\b', \"don't\"),\n        (r'\\b(going to)\\b', 'gonna'),\n        (r'\\b(combination)\\b', 'combo')\n    ]\n    \n    result = phrase\n    \n    # Apply each replacement\n    for pattern, replacement in replacements:\n        # Use a function to handle capitalization\n        def replace_func(match):\n            original = match.group(1)\n            if original[0].isupper():\n                return replacement.capitalize()\n            else:\n                return replacement\n        \n        # Apply the replacement with case sensitivity\n        result = re.sub(pattern, replace_func, result, flags=re.IGNORECASE)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input and process\ninput_phrase = input()\noutput_phrase = gymSlang(input_phrase)\nprint(output_phrase)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [2167], "completion_tokens": [235], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3884}

{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef convert_yellow_colors(color):\n    #
