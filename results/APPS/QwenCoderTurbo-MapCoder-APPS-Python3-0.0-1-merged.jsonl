{"name": "3554", "description": "Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 × Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.

{"name": "3478", "description": "Magic The Gathering is a collectible card game that features wizards battling against each other with spells and creature summons. The game itself can be quite complicated to learn. In this series of katas, we'll be solving some of the situations that arise during gameplay. You won't need any prior knowledge of the game to solve these contrived problems, as I will provide you with enough information.\n\n## Creatures\n\nEach creature has a power and toughness. We will represent this in an array. [2, 3] means this creature has a power of 2 and a toughness of 3.\n\nWhen two creatures square off, they each deal damage equal to their power to each other at the same time. If a creature takes on damage greater than or equal to their toughness, they die.\n\nExamples:\n\n- Creature 1 - [2, 3]\n- Creature 2 - [3, 3]\n- Creature 3 - [1, 4]\n- Creature 4 - [4, 1]\n\nIf creature 1 battles creature 2, creature 1 dies, while 2 survives. If creature 3 battles creature 4, they both die, as 3 deals 1 damage to 4, but creature 4 only has a toughness of 1.\n\nWrite a function `battle(player1, player2)` that takes in 2 arrays of creatures. Each players' creatures battle each other in order (player1[0] battles the creature in player2[0]) and so on. If one list of creatures is longer than the other, those creatures are considered unblocked, and do not battle.\n\nYour function should return an object (a hash in Ruby) with the keys player1 and player2 that contain the power and toughness of the surviving creatures.\n\nExample:\n```\nGood luck with your battles!\n\n\nCheck out my other Magic The Gathering katas:\n\n\nMagic The Gathering #1: Creatures\nMagic The Gathering #2: Mana", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3478, "sample_io": [], "test_list": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1]]\n[[1, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 1]]\n[[2, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 2]]\n[[1, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 2]], "player2": [[1, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 3]]\n[[3, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 7]]\n[[3, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[2, 7]], "player2": [[3, 5]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 5]]\n[[6, 6]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[6, 6]]}]}, {"input": "[[6, 6]]\n[[2, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[6, 6]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[]\n[[1, 1], [2, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[1, 1], [2, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1], [2, 2]]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 1], [2, 2]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 2]]\n[[2, 4], [6, 1], [4, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 3], [4, 6]], "player2": [[2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]}]}], "starter_code": "\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n\t", "source_codes": ["import sys\nimport json\n\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    #

Any resemblance to real people or real events is **nothing more than a coincidence** and should be regarded as such.\n\n## Background Story\n\nYou are a person who loves to go to the gym everyday with the squad of people that you've known since early childhood.  However, you recently contracted a sickness that forced you to stay at home for over a week.  As you see your body getting weaker and weaker every day and as you see your biceps and triceps disappearing, you can't help but lay in bed and cry.  You're usually an optimistic person but this time negative thoughts come to your head ... \n\n![When I miss few days of gym](https://pics.onsizzle.com/Instagram-faf8c9.png)\n\n\n## Task\n\nAs can be seen from the funny image above (or am I the only person to find the picture above hilarious?) there is lots of slang.  Your task is to define a function ```gymSlang``` which accepts a string argument and does the following:\n\n1. Replace *all* instances of ```\"probably\"``` to ```\"prolly\"```\n2. Replace *all* instances of ```\"i am\"``` to ```\"i'm\"```\n3. Replace *all* instances of ```\"instagram\"``` to ```\"insta\"```\n4. Replace *all* instances of ```\"do not\"``` to ```\"don't\"```\n5. Replace *all* instances of ```\"going to\"``` to ```\"gonna\"```\n6. Replace *all* instances of ```\"combination\"``` to ```\"combo\"```\n\nYour replacement regexes **should be case-sensitive**, only replacing the words above with slang if the detected pattern is in **lowercase**.

{"name": "4391", "description": "## The Story\nGreen Lantern's long hours of study and practice with his ring have really paid off -- his skills, focus, and control have improved so much that now he can even use his ring to update and redesign his web site. Earlier today he was focusing his will and a beam from his ring upon the Justice League web server, while intensely brainstorming and visualizing in minute detail different looks and ideas for his web site, and when he finished and reloaded his home page, he was absolutely thrilled to see that among other things it now displayed\n\n~~~~\nIn brightest day, in blackest night,\nThere's nothing cooler than my site!\n~~~~\n\nin his favorite font in very large blinking green letters.\n\nThe problem is, Green Lantern's ring has no power over anything yellow, so if he's experimenting with his web site and accidentally changes some text or background color to yellow, he will no longer be able to make any changes to those parts of the content or presentation (because he doesn't actually know any HTML, CSS, programming languages, frameworks, etc.) until he gets a more knowledgable friend to edit the code for him.\n\n## Your Mission\nYou can help Green Lantern by writing a function that will replace any color property values that are too yellow with shades of green or blue-green. Presumably at a later time the two of you will be doing some testing to find out at exactly which RGB values yellow stops being yellow and starts being off-white, orange, brown, etc. as far as his ring is concerned, but here's the plan to get version 1.0 up and running as soon as possible:\n\nYour function will receive either an HTML color name or a six-digit hex color code. (You're not going to bother with other types of color codes just now because you don't think they will come up.) If the color is too yellow, your function needs to return a green or blue-green shade instead, but if it is not too yellow, it needs to return the original color name or hex color code unchanged.\n\n### HTML Color Names\n(If don't know what HTML color names are, take a look at this HTML colors names reference.)\n\nFor HMTL color names, you are going to start out trying a pretty strict definition of yellow, replacing any of the following colors as specified:\n\n~~~~\nGold => ForestGreen\nKhaki => LimeGreen\nLemonChiffon => PaleGreen\nLightGoldenRodYellow => SpringGreen\nLightYellow => MintCream\nPaleGoldenRod => LightGreen\nYellow => Lime\n~~~~\n\nHTML color names are case-insensitive, so your function will need to be able to identify the above yellow shades regardless of the cases used, but should output the green shades as capitalized above.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"lemonchiffon\"    \"PaleGreen\"\n\"GOLD\"            \"ForestGreen\"\n\"pAlEgOlDeNrOd\"   \"LightGreen\"\n\"BlueViolet\"      \"BlueViolet\"\n```\n\n### Hex Color Codes\n(If you don't know what six-digit hex color codes are, take a look at this Wikipedia description. Basically the six digits are made up of three two-digit numbers in base 16, known as hexidecimal or hex, from 00 to FF (equivalent to 255 in base 10, also known as decimal), with the first two-digit number specifying the color's red value, the second the green value, and the third blue.)\n\nWith six-digit color hex codes, you are going to start out going really overboard, interpreting as \"yellow\" any hex code where the red (R) value and the green (G) value are each greater than the blue (B) value. When you find one of these \"yellow\" hex codes, your function will take the three hex values and rearrange them that the largest goes to G, the middle goes to B, and the smallest to R. \n\nFor example, with the six-digit hex color code `#FFD700`, which has an R value of hex FF (decimal 255), a G value of hex D7 (decimal 215), and a B value of hex 00 (decimal 0), as the R and G values are each larger than the B value, you would return it as `#00FFD7` -- the FF reassigned to G, the D7 to B, and the 00 to R. \n\nHex color codes are also case-insensitive, but your function should output them in the same case they were received in, just for consistency with whatever style is being used.\n\nSome examples:\n```\n\"#000000\"   \"#000000\"\n\"#b8860b\"   \"#0bb886\"\n\"#8FBC8F\"   \"#8FBC8F\"\n\"#C71585\"   \"#C71585\"\n```", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 4391, "sample_io": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "lemonchiffon", "output": ["PaleGreen"]}, {"input": "GOLD", "output": ["ForestGreen"]}, {"input": "pAlEgOlDeNrOd", "output": ["LightGreen"]}, {"input": "BlueViolet", "output": ["BlueViolet"]}, {"input": "#000000", "output": ["#000000"]}, {"input": "#b8860b", "output": ["#0bb886"]}, {"input": "#8FBC8F", "output": ["#8FBC8F"]}, {"input": "#C71585", "output": ["#C71585"]}], "starter_code": "\ndef yellow_be_gone(s):\n\t", "source_codes": ["def convert_yellow_color(color):\n    #

The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "1232\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "123220\n6", "output": [true]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["def base_to_decimal(s, base):\n    \"\"\"Convert a number string in given base to decimal.\"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for char in s:\n        result = result * base + CHARS.index(char)\n    return result\n\ndef decimal_to_base(n, base):\n    \"\"\"Convert a decimal number to given base string.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n:\n        digits.append(CHARS[n % base])\n        n //= base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef is_polydivisible(n, b):\n    \"\"\"Check if number string n is polydivisible in base b.\"\"\"\n    for i in range(1, len(n) + 1):\n        prefix = n[:i]\n        decimal_value = base_to_decimal(prefix, b)\n        if decimal_value % i != 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    \"\"\"Get the nth polydivisible number in base b.\"\"\"\n    if n == 1:\n        return '0'\n    \n    #

{"name": "1663", "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

{"name": "1654", "description": "To give credit where credit is due: This problem was taken from the ACMICPC-Northwest Regional Programming Contest. Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark.

Same goes for all the numbers up to 109, while 110 is again a decreasing number.\n\nNow your task is rather easy to declare (a bit less to perform): you have to build a function to return the total occurrences of all the increasing or decreasing numbers *below* 10 raised to the xth power (x will always be >= 0).\n\nTo give you a starting point, there are a grand total of increasing and decreasing numbers as shown in the table:\n\n|Total  | Below\n|---------------\n|1      | 1\n|10     | 10\n|100    | 100\n|475    | 1000\n|1675   | 10000\n|4954   | 100000\n|12952  | 1000000\n\nThis means that your function will have to behave like this:\n```python\ntotal_inc_dec(0)==1\ntotal_inc_dec(1)==10\ntotal_inc_dec(2)==100\ntotal_inc_dec(3)==475\ntotal_inc_dec(4)==1675\ntotal_inc_dec(5)==4954\ntotal_inc_dec(6)==12952\n```\n\n**Tips:** efficiency and trying to figure out how it works are essential: with a brute force approach, some tests with larger numbers may take more than the total computing power currently on Earth to be finished in the short allotted time.\n\nTo make it even clearer, the increasing or decreasing numbers between in the range 101-200 are: [110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 166, 167, 168, 169, 177, 178, 179, 188, 189, 199, 200], that is 47 of them. In the following range, 201-300, there are 41 of them and so on, getting rarer and rarer.\n\n**Trivia:** just for the sake of your own curiosity, a number which is neither decreasing of increasing is called a `bouncy` number, like, say, 3848 or 37294; also, usually 0 is not considered being increasing, decreasing or bouncy, but it will be for the purpose of this kata", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1634, "sample_io": [{"input": "0", "output": [1]}, {"input": "1", "output": [10]}, {"input": "2", "output": [100]}, {"input": "3", "output": [475]}, {"input": "4", "output": [1675]}, {"input": "5", "output": [4954]}, {"input": "6", "output": [12952]}], "test_list": [{"input": "0", "output": [1]}, {"input": "1", "output": [10]}, {"input": "2", "output": [100]}, {"input": "3", "output": [475]}, {"input": "4", "output": [1675]}, {"input": "5", "output": [4954]}, {"input": "6", "output": [12952]}, {"input": "10", "output": [277033]}, {"input": "20", "output": [40059819]}, {"input": "50", "output": [87959698326]}], "starter_code": "\ndef total_inc_dec(x):\n\t", "source_codes": ["import sys\n\nsys.setrecursionlimit(10000)\n\ndef total_inc_dec(x):\n    if x == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Memoization dictionaries\n    memo_inc = {}\n    memo_dec = {}\n    memo_rep = {}\n    \n    # Convert 10^x to string to get the length\n    s = '9' * x  # All 9s with x digits\n    length = x\n    \n    # Count increasing numbers with digit DP\n    def count_increasing(pos, prev_digit, tight, started):\n        if pos == length:\n            return 1 if started else 0\n        \n        if (pos, prev_digit, tight, started) in memo_inc:\n            return memo_inc[(pos, prev_digit, tight, started)]\n        \n        limit = int(s[pos]) if tight else 9\n        res = 0\n        for digit in range(0, limit + 1):\n            if not started and digit == 0:\n                # Leading zero, don't update prev_digit\n                res += count_increasing(pos + 1, prev_digit, tight and (digit == limit), False)\n            elif digit >= prev_digit:\n                res += count_increasing(pos + 1, digit, tight and (digit == limit), True)\n        \n        memo_inc[(pos, prev_digit, tight, started)] = res\n        return res\n    \n    # Count decreasing numbers with digit DP\n    def count_decreasing(pos, prev_digit, tight, started):\n        if pos == length:\n            return 1 if started else 0\n        \n        if (pos, prev_digit, tight, started) in memo_dec:\n            return memo_dec[(pos, prev_digit, tight, started)]\n        \n        limit = int(s[pos]) if tight else 9\n        res = 0\n        for digit in range(0, limit + 1):\n            if not started and digit == 0:\n                # Leading zero, don't update prev_digit\n                res += count_decreasing(pos + 1, prev_digit, tight and (digit == limit), False)\n            elif digit <= prev_digit:\n                res += count_decreasing(pos + 1, digit, tight and (digit == limit), True)\n        \n        memo_dec[(pos, prev_digit, tight, started)] = res\n        return res\n    \n    # Count numbers with all same digits (repeating)\n    def count_repeating(pos, prev_digit, tight, started):\n        if pos == length:\n            return 1 if started else 0\n        \n        if (pos, prev_digit, tight, started) in memo_rep:\n            return memo_rep[(pos, prev_digit, tight, started)]\n        \n        limit = int(s[pos]) if tight else 9\n        res = 0\n        for digit in range(0, limit + 1):\n            if not started and digit == 0:\n                # Leading zero\n                res += count_repeating(pos + 1, prev_digit, tight and (digit == limit), False)\n            elif not started or digit == prev_digit:\n                res += count_repeating(pos + 1, digit, tight and (digit == limit), True)\n        \n        memo_rep[(pos, prev_digit, tight, started)] = res\n        return res\n    \n    # Calculate counts\n    inc_count = count_increasing(0, 0, True, False)\n    dec_count = count_decreasing(0, 9, True, False)\n    rep_count = count_repeating(0, 0, True, False)\n    \n    # Apply inclusion-exclusion principle\n    total = inc_count + dec_count -

For example, 4 can be partitioned in five distinct ways:\n```\n4\n3 + 1\n2 + 2\n2 + 1 + 1\n1 + 1 + 1 + 1\n```\n\n## Examples\n\n### Basic\n\n```python\nexp_sum(1) # 1\nexp_sum(2) # 2  -> 1+1 , 2\nexp_sum(3) # 3 -> 1+1+1, 1+2, 3\nexp_sum(4) # 5 -> 1+1+1+1, 1+1+2, 1+3, 2+2, 4\nexp_sum(5) # 7 -> 1+1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+2, 1+1+3, 1+2+2, 1+4, 5, 2+3\n\nexp_sum(10) # 42\n```\n\n### Explosive\n\n```python\nexp_sum(50) # 204226\nexp_sum(80) # 15796476\nexp_sum(100) # 190569292\n```\n\nSee [here](http://www.numericana.com/data/partition.htm) for more examples.", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1659, "sample_io": [{"input": "1", "output": [1]}, {"input": "2", "output": [2]}, {"input": "3", "output": [3]}, {"input": "4", "output": [5]}, {"input": "5", "output": [7]}, {"input": "10", "output": [42]}, {"input": "50", "output": [204226]}, {"input": "80", "output": [15796476]}, {"input": "100", "output": [190569292]}], "test_list": [{"input": "1", "output": [1]}, {"input": "2", "output": [2]}, {"input": "3", "output": [3]}, {"input": "4", "output": [5]}, {"input": "5", "output": [7]}, {"input": "20", "output": [627]}, {"input": "30", "output": [5604]}, {"input": "40", "output": [37338]}, {"input": "43", "output": [63261]}, {"input": "60", "output": [966467]}, {"input": "70", "output": [4087968]}, {"input": "90", "output": [56634173]}, {"input": "200", "output": [3972999029388]}, {"input": "275", "output": [1520980492851175]}], "starter_code": "\ndef exp_sum(n):\n\t", "source_codes": ["def exp_sum(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize dp array\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    # Generate generalized pentagonal numbers and apply Euler's recurrence\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        j = 1\n        while True:\n            # First pentagonal number: j(3j-1)/2\n            pent1 = j * (3 * j - 1) // 2\n            if pent1 > i:\n                break\n            \n            # Add or subtract based on parity of j\n            if j % 2 == 1:\n                dp[i] += dp[i - pent1]\n            else:\n                dp[i] -= dp[i - pent1]\n            \n            # Second pentagonal number: j(3j+1)/2\n            pent2 = j * (3 * j + 1) // 2\n            if pent2 > i:\n                break\n            \n            # Add or subtract based on parity of j\n            if j % 2 == 1:\n                dp[i] += dp[i - pent2]\n            else:\n                dp[i] -= dp[i - pent2]\n                \n            j += 1\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(exp_sum(n))"], "responses": ["\ndef exp_sum(n):\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize dp array\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = 1\n    \n    # Generate generalized pentagonal numbers and apply Euler's recurrence\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        j = 1\n        while True:\n            # First pentagonal number: j(3j-1)/2\n            pent1 = j * (3 * j - 1) // 2\n            if pent1 > i:\n                break\n            \n            # Add or subtract based on parity of j\n            if j % 2 == 1:\n                dp[i] += dp[i - pent1]\n            else:\n                dp[i] -= dp[i - pent1]\n            \n            # Second pentagonal number: j(3j+1)/2\n            pent2 = j * (3 * j + 1) // 2\n            if pent2 > i:\n                break\n            \n            # Add or subtract based on parity of j\n            if j % 2 == 1:\n                dp[i] += dp[i - pent2]\n            else:\n                dp[i] -= dp[i - pent2]\n                \n            j += 1\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\nn = int(input())\nprint(exp_sum(n))\n\n\n"], "prompt_tokens": [10721], "completion_tokens": [4119], "no_of_try": 1, "api_calls": 10, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1659}

You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.\n\nThe labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.\n\nCount the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo $10^9 + 7$.

{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24.

{"name": "1663", "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases.

If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

{"name": "2092", "description": "There are literally dozens of snooker competitions held each year, and team Jinotega tries to attend them all (for some reason they prefer name \"snookah\")! When a competition takes place somewhere far from their hometown, Ivan, Artsem and Konstantin take a flight to the contest and back.\n\nJinotega's best friends, team Base have found a list of their itinerary receipts with information about departure and arrival airports. Now they wonder, where is Jinotega now: at home or at some competition far away? They know that:   this list contains all Jinotega's flights in this year (in arbitrary order),  Jinotega has only flown from his hometown to a snooker contest and back,  after each competition Jinotega flies back home (though they may attend a competition in one place several times),  and finally, at the beginning of the year Jinotega was at home. \n\nPlease help them to determine Jinotega's location!\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nIn the first line of input there is a single integer n: the number of Jinotega's flights (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

There should be exactly $q$ answers, one after every update.\n\nYou can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWe'll crack down the example test here:  After the first query, the girl still able to reach the goal. One of the shortest path ways should be: $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (1,3) \\to (1,4) \\to (1,5) \\to (2,5)$.  After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.  After the fifth query, the column barrier has been lifted, thus she can go to the final goal again.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2064, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n",

Formally, if two elements are equal, everything in between must also be equal.\n\nLet's define difficulty of a sequence as a minimum possible number of elements to change to get a nice sequence. However, if you change at least one element of value $x$ to value $y$, you must also change all other elements of value $x$ into $y$ as well. For example, for $[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2]$ it isn't allowed to change first $1$ to $3$ and second $1$ to $2$.

{"name": "2183", "description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n\nOutput\n25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's illustrate what happens with the first test case. Initially, we have $s = $ 231. Initially, $\\ell = 0$ and $c = \\varepsilon$ (the empty string). The following things happen if we follow the procedure above:\n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 1$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2 and $c = $ 31.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 2 times: we get $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 1 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 4 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 5 = x$, so we stop. \n\nAt the end of the procedure, $s$ has length $25$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2183, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n", "output": ["25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n", "output": ["25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n"]}, {"input": "9\n1500\n1212\n1500\n1221\n1500\n122\n1500\n12121\n1500\n22\n1500\n1111112111111112\n1500\n1111111111221111111\n1500\n111111122\n1500\n11111121111121111111\n", "output": ["1504\n1599\n1502\n1598\n1502\n1510\n1657\n1502\n1763\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n22\n", "output": ["1000002\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n221\n", "output": ["1001822\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n1221\n", "output": ["1001823\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2121\n", "output": ["1001821\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2211\n", "output": ["1002004\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n1212\n", "output": ["1000004\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2112\n", "output": ["1000006\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": [""], "responses": [""], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2183}

{"name": "2095", "description": "A tree is an undirected connected graph without cycles.\n\nLet's consider a rooted undirected tree with n vertices, numbered 1 through n. There are many ways to represent such a tree. One way is to create an array with n integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, where p_{i} denotes a parent of vertex i (here, for convenience a root is considered its own parent). [Image] For this rooted tree the array p is [2, 3, 3, 2]. \n\nGiven a sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n}, one is able to restore a tree:  There must be exactly one index r that p_{r} = r. A vertex r is a root of the tree.  For all other n - 1 vertices i, there is an edge between vertex i and vertex p_{i}. \n\nA sequence p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} is called valid if the described procedure generates some (any) rooted tree. For example, for n = 3 sequences (1,2,2), (2,3,1) and (2,1,3) are not valid.\n\nYou are given a sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, not necessarily valid. Your task is to change the minimum number of elements, in order to get a valid sequence. Print the minimum number of changes and an example of a valid sequence after that number of changes. If there are many valid sequences achievable in the minimum number of changes, print any of them.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of vertices in the tree.\n\nThe second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the first line print the minimum number of elements to change, in order to get a valid sequence.\n\nIn the second line, print any valid sequence possible to get from (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}) in the minimum number of changes.

In the provided output, a sequence represents a tree rooted in a vertex 4 (because p_4 = 4), which you can see on the left drawing below. One of other correct solutions would be a sequence 2 3 3 2, representing a tree rooted in vertex 3 (right drawing below). On both drawings, roots are painted red.

{"name": "2037", "description": "You work in a big office. It is a 9 floor building with an elevator that can accommodate up to 4 people. It is your responsibility to manage this elevator.\n\nToday you are late, so there are queues on some floors already. For each person you know the floor where he currently is and the floor he wants to reach. Also, you know the order in which people came to the elevator.\n\nAccording to the company's rules, if an employee comes to the elevator earlier than another one, he has to enter the elevator earlier too (even if these employees stay on different floors). Note that the employees are allowed to leave the elevator in arbitrary order.\n\nThe elevator has two commands:   Go up or down one floor. The movement takes 1 second.  Open the doors on the current floor. During this operation all the employees who have reached their destination get out of the elevator. Then all the employees on the floor get in the elevator in the order they are queued up while it doesn't contradict the company's rules and there is enough space in the elevator. Each employee spends 1 second to get inside and outside the elevator. \n\nInitially the elevator is empty and is located on the floor 1.\n\nYou are interested what is the minimum possible time you need to spend to deliver all the employees to their destination. It is not necessary to return the elevator to the floor 1.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000) — the number of employees.\n\nThe i-th of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 9, a_{i} ≠ b_{i}) — the floor on which an employee initially is, and the floor he wants to reach.\n\nThe employees are given in the order they came to the elevator.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer — the minimal possible time in seconds.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n2\n3 5\n5 3\n\nOutput\n10\nInput\n2\n5 3\n3 5\n\nOutput\n12\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\n Explaination for the first sample [Image] t = 0\n\n[Image] t = 2\n\n[Image] t = 3\n\n[Image] t = 5\n\n[Image] t = 6\n\n[Image] t = 7\n\n[Image] t = 9\n\n[Image] t = 10", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2037, "sample_io": [{"input": "2\n3 5\n5 3\n", "output": ["10"]}, {"input": "2\n5 3\n3 5\n", "output": ["12"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "2\n3 5\n5 3\n", "output": ["10"]}, {"input": "2\n5 3\n3 5\n", "output": ["12"]}, {"input": "9\n1 2\n2 3\n3 4\n4 5\n5 6\n6 7\n7 8\n8 9\n9 1\n", "output": ["34"]}, {"input": "50\n9 5\n2 6\n5 4\n7 5\n3 6\n5 8\n1 2\n6 1\n9 7\n8 1\n9 5\n6 8\n6 8\n2 8\n4 9\n6 7\n7 8\n5 8\n1 2\n9 2\n5 9\n6 7\n3 2\n9 8\n7 8\n7 4\n6 5\n1 7\n6 5\n2 6\n3 1\n6 5\n3 7\n9 3\n8 1\n8 3\n8 2\n1 9\n9 2\n3 2\n8 7\n5 1\n6 2\n2 1\n6 1\n3 4\n4 1\n2 3\n2 6\n2 9\n", "output": ["278"]}, {"input": "50\n8 9\n6 7\n6 8\n4 1\n3 2\n9 3\n8 3\n9 7\n4 6\n4 6\n5 6\n7 2\n6 3\n1 3\n8 2\n4 6\n6 8\n7 6\n8 6\n9 4\n8 6\n9 1\n3 8\n3 1\n4 7\n4 9\n9 1\n7 4\n3 5\n1 7\n3 5\n8 9\n5 4\n2 9\n2 9\n3 9\n8 5\n4 9\n9 4\n5 6\n6 1\n4 2\n3 9\n9 1\n9 4\n4 5\n2 4\n2 6\n3 6\n1 9\n", "output": ["252"]}, {"input": "50\n3 9\n8 9\n7 2\n9 1\n5 2\n2 8\n2 4\n8 6\n4 6\n1 6\n5 3\n3 8\n8 2\n6 7\n7 1\n2 4\n2 8\n3 7\n7 1\n7 9\n9 3\n7 2\n2 7\n8 4\n5 8\n6 8\n7 1\n7 5\n5 6\n9 1\n8 6\n3 6\n7 6\n4 3\n3 2\n9 2\n4 9\n2 1\n7 9\n1 8\n4 9\n5 2\n7 2\n9 8\n3 1\n4 5\n3 4\n2 7\n2 1\n6 1\n", "output": ["260"]}, {"input": "50\n7 1\n4 8\n9 3\n9 3\n2 4\n5 9\n1 5\n1 4\n7 6\n4 8\n3 6\n2 8\n5 1\n8 9\n7 4\n7 2\n2 4\n7 9\n8 7\n3 8\n1 7\n4 5\n7 2\n6 4\n6 1\n4 8\n5 6\n4 3\n6 5\n6 4\n6 9\n2 5\n9 3\n3 4\n3 4\n9 3\n7 9\n5 8\n1 6\n5 1\n8 3\n7 4\n1 8\n5 2\n1 7\n6 1\n9 6\n3 1\n6 5\n9 7\n", "output": ["274"]}, {"input": "50\n1 9\n9 4\n4 2\n2 4\n3 8\n9 5\n3 2\n8 3\n8 1\n4 7\n5 3\n2 6\n1 8\n6 5\n4 1\n5 7\n1 4\n4 7\n5 4\n8 2\n4 6\n8 7\n1 9\n1 6\n6 4\n5 2\n5 3\n2 6\n4 6\n5 2\n6 7\n5 3\n9 5\n8 3\n1 9\n2 6\n5 1\n7 3\n4 3\n7 2\n4 3\n5 7\n6 8\n8 2\n3 6\n4 9\n1 8\n7 8\n5 4\n7 6\n", "output": ["258"]}, {"input": "50\n5 9\n1 2\n6 9\n1 6\n8 1\n5 3\n2 1\n2 7\n6 1\n4 3\n6 1\n2 6\n2 8\n2 1\n3 4\n6 2\n4 8\n6 4\n2 1\n1 5\n4 9\n6 8\n4 1\n1 6\n1 5\n5 9\n2 6\n6 9\n4 2\n4 7\n8 2\n4 6\n2 5\n9 4\n3 1\n8 4\n3 9\n1 3\n2 3\n8 7\n5 4\n2 6\n9 5\n6 2\n5 8\n2 8\n8 9\n9 2\n5 3\n9 1\n", "output": ["282"]}, {"input": "50\n9 8\n8 9\n2 3\n2 6\n7 6\n9 8\n7 5\n8 5\n2 9\n4 2\n4 6\n9 4\n1 9\n4 8\n7 9\n7 4\n4 7\n7 6\n8 9\n2 8\n1 3\n6 7\n6 3\n1 8\n9 3\n4 9\n9 6\n4 2\n6 5\n3 8\n9 3\n7 5\n9 6\n5 6\n4 7\n5 7\n9 1\n7 5\n5 6\n3 1\n4 3\n7 1\n9 8\n7 8\n3 7\n8 3\n9 6\n5 7\n1 8\n6 4\n", "output": ["275"]}, {"input": "9\n2 1\n5 9\n2 6\n2 6\n4 7\n7 3\n3 1\n3 1\n7 8\n", "output": ["46"]}, {"input": "5\n1 7\n2 5\n8 6\n3 4\n1 6\n", "output": ["29"]}, {"input": "4\n2 1\n1 7\n5 8\n8 4\n", "output": ["21"]}, {"input": "1\n1 9\n", "output": ["10"]}, {"input": "1\n9 1\n", "output": ["18"]}, {"input": "1\n1 5\n", "output": ["6"]}, {"input": "1\n8 6\n", "output": ["11"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["def main():\n    n = int(input())\n    passengers = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        passengers.append((a, b, i))  #

She began to write a light novel for the kingdom as soon as she woke up, and of course, she is the queen of it.\n\n[Image] \n\nThere are $n$ cities and $n-1$ two-way roads connecting pairs of cities in the kingdom. From any city, you can reach any other city by walking through some roads. The cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and the city $1$ is the capital of the kingdom. So, the kingdom has a tree structure.\n\nAs the queen, Linova plans to choose exactly $k$ cities developing industry, while the other cities will develop tourism. The capital also can be either industrial or tourism city.\n\nA meeting is held in the capital once a year. To attend the meeting, each industry city sends an envoy. All envoys will follow the shortest path from the departure city to the capital (which is unique).\n\nTraveling in tourism cities is pleasant. For each envoy, his happiness is equal to the number of tourism cities on his path.\n\nIn order to be a queen loved by people, Linova wants to choose $k$ cities which can maximize the sum of happinesses of all envoys. Can you calculate the maximum sum for her?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2\\le n\\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$, $1\\le k< n$)  — the number of cities and industry cities respectively.\n\nEach of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1\\le u,v\\le n$), denoting there is a road connecting city $u$ and city $v$.\n\nIt is guaranteed that from any city, you can reach any other city by the roads.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only line containing a single integer  — the maximum possible sum of happinesses of all envoys.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n7 4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n4 7\n\nOutput\n7\nInput\n4 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n\nOutput\n2\nInput\n8 5\n7 5\n1 7\n6 1\n3 7\n8 3\n2 1\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\n[Image]\n\nIn the first example, Linova can choose cities $2$, $5$, $6$, $7$ to develop industry, then the happiness of the envoy from city $2$ is $1$, the happiness of envoys from cities $5$, $6$, $7$ is $2$. The sum of happinesses is $7$, and it can be proved to be the maximum one.\n\n[Image]\n\nIn the second example, choosing cities $3$, $4$ developing industry can reach a sum of $3$, but remember that Linova plans to choose exactly $k$ cities developing industry, then the maximum sum is $2$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2199, "sample_io": [{"input": "7 4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n4 7\n", "output": ["7"]}, {"input": "4 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n", "output": ["2"]}, {"input": "8 5\n7 5\n1 7\n6 1\n3 7\n8 3\n2 1\n4 5\n", "output": ["9"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "7 4\n1 2\n1 3\n1 4\n3 5\n3 6\n4 7\n", "output": ["7"]}, {"input": "4 1\n1 2\n1 3\n2 4\n", "output": ["2"]}, {"input": "8 5\n7 5\n1 7\n6 1\n3 7\n8 3\n2 1\n4 5\n", "output": ["9"]}, {"input": "2 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1"]}, {"input": "20 7\n9 7\n3 7\n15 9\n1 3\n11 9\n18 7\n17 18\n20 1\n4 11\n2 11\n12 18\n8 18\n13 2\n19 2\n10 9\n6 13\n5 8\n14 1\n16 13\n", "output": ["38"]}, {"input": "3 2\n1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["2"]}, {"input": "3 1\n1 2\n2 3\n", "output": ["2"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["import sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    \n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Build adjacency list\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n    \n    # First DFS to compute depth and subtree size\n    depth = [0] * (n + 1)\n    subtree_size = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    def dfs(u, p, d):\n        depth[u] = d\n        size = 1\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if v == p:\n                continue\n            size += dfs(v, u, d + 1)\n        subtree_size[u] = size\n        return size\n    \n    dfs(1, -1, 0)\n    \n    # Calculate contribution for each node\n    contribution = []\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):  # Exclude the root (it doesn't contribute to happiness)\n        contrib = depth[i] - (subtree_size[i] - 1)\n        contribution.append(contrib)\n    \n    # Sort by contribution descending\n    contribution.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Sum top k contributions\n    total = sum(contribution[:k])\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()"], "responses": ["\nimport sys\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    sys.setrecursionlimit(1 << 25)\n    \n    n, k = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n    \n    # Build adjacency list\n    adj = defaultdict(list)\n    for _ in range(n - 1):\n        u, v = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())\n        adj[u].append(v)\n        adj[v].append(u)\n    \n    # First DFS to compute depth and subtree size\n    depth = [0] * (n + 1)\n    subtree_size = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    def dfs(u, p, d):\n        depth[u] = d\n        size = 1\n        for v in adj[u]:\n            if v == p:\n                continue\n            size += dfs(v, u, d + 1)\n        subtree_size[u] = size\n        return size\n    \n    dfs(1, -1, 0)\n    \n    # Calculate contribution for each node\n    contribution = []\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):  # Exclude the root (it doesn't contribute to happiness)\n        contrib = depth[i] - (subtree_size[i] - 1)\n        contribution.append(contrib)\n    \n    # Sort by contribution descending\n    contribution.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Sum top k contributions\n    total = sum(contribution[:k])\n    \n    print(total)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\n\n"], "prompt_tokens": [14297], "completion_tokens": [6016], "no_of_try": 1, "api_calls": 10, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2199}

The $i$-th box contains $n_i$ integer numbers. The integers can be negative. All of the integers are distinct. \n\nUjan is lazy, so he will do the following reordering of the numbers exactly once. He will pick a single integer from each of the boxes, $k$ integers in total. Then he will insert the chosen numbers — one integer in each of the boxes, so that the number of integers in each box is the same as in the beginning. Note that he may also insert an integer he picked from a box back into the same box.\n\nUjan will be happy if the sum of the integers in each box is the same. Can he achieve this and make the boxes perfectly balanced, like all things should be?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \\leq k \\leq 15$), the number of boxes. \n\nThe $i$-th of the next $k$ lines first contains a single integer $n_i$ ($1 \\leq n_i \\leq 5\\,000$), the number of integers in box $i$. Then the same line contains $n_i$ integers $a_{i,1}, \\ldots, a_{i,n_i}$ ($|a_{i,j}| \\leq 10^9$), the integers in the $i$-th box. \n\nIt is guaranteed that all $a_{i,j}$ are distinct.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf Ujan cannot achieve his goal, output \"No\" in a single line. Otherwise in the first line output \"Yes\", and then output $k$ lines. The $i$-th of these lines should contain two integers $c_i$ and $p_i$. This means that Ujan should pick the integer $c_i$ from the $i$-th box and place it in the $p_i$-th box afterwards.\n\nIf there are multiple solutions, output any of those.\n\nYou can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n3 1 7 4\n2 3 2\n2 8 5\n1 10\n\nOutput\nYes\n7 2\n2 3\n5 1\n10 4\n\nInput\n2\n2 3 -2\n2 -1 5\n\nOutput\nNo\n\nInput\n2\n2 -10 10\n2 0 -20\n\nOutput\nYes\n-10 2\n-20 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample, Ujan can put the number $7$ in the $2$nd box, the number $2$ in the $3$rd box, the number $5$ in the $1$st box and keep the number $10$ in the same $4$th box.

{"name": "2070", "description": "Karen has just arrived at school, and she has a math test today! [Image] \n\nThe test is about basic addition and subtraction. Unfortunately, the teachers were too busy writing tasks for Codeforces rounds, and had no time to make an actual test. So, they just put one question in the test that is worth all the points.\n\nThere are n integers written on a row. Karen must alternately add and subtract each pair of adjacent integers, and write down the sums or differences on the next row. She must repeat this process on the values on the next row, and so on, until only one integer remains.

{"name": "2047", "description": "Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 2\n1 0\n0 2\n0 1\n0 2\n", "output": ["7\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 1 1\n2 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "7 14\n2 11 1 14 9 8 5\n12 6 7 1 10 2 3\n14 13 9 8 5 4 11\n13 6 4 3 12 7 10\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "2 1\n0 0\n0 0\n0 1\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "2 3\n0 2\n0 1\n3 2\n3 1\n", "output": ["7\n1 2 1\n2 2 2\n3 4 1\n1 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n", "output": ["2\n1 3 1\n1 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 4\n3 4\n2 1\n3 4\n2 1\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "3 5\n2 1 5\n5 3 2\n4 0 1\n0 4 3\n", "output": ["18\n4 3 2\n5 3 1\n3 2 1\n2 2 2\n1 2 3\n4 4 2\n5 3 2\n3 3 1\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n5 3 3\n3 3 2\n2 1 1\n1 1 2\n5 2 3\n3 3 3\n5 1 3\n3 4 3\n"]}, {"input": "10 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["1\n1 1 3\n"]}, {"input": "50 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["34\n1 3 27\n1 3 28\n1 3 29\n1 3 30\n1 3 31\n1 3 32\n1 3 33\n1 3 34\n1 3 35\n1 3 36\n1 3 37\n1 3 38\n1 3 39\n1 3 40\n1 3 41\n1 3 42\n1 3 43\n1 3 44\n1 3 45\n1 3 46\n1 3 47\n1 3 48\n1 3 49\n1 3 50\n1 2 50\n1 2 49\n1 2 48\n1 2 47\n1 2 46\n1 2 45\n1 2 44\n1 2 43\n1 2 42\n1 1 42\n"]}, {"input": "22 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["65\n2 2 13\n1 3 21\n2 2 12\n1 3 22\n2 2 11\n1 2 22\n2 2 10\n1 2 21\n2 2 9\n1 2 20\n2 2 8\n1 2 19\n2 2 7\n1 2 18\n2 2 6\n1 2 17\n2 2 5\n1 2 16\n2 2 4\n1 2 15\n2 2 3\n1 2 14\n2 2 2\n1 2 13\n2 2 1\n1 2 12\n2 3 1\n1 2 11\n2 3 2\n1 2 10\n2 3 3\n1 2 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 8\n2 3 5\n1 2 7\n2 3 6\n1 2 6\n2 3 7\n1 2 5\n2 3 8\n1 2 4\n2 3 9\n1 2 3\n2 3 10\n1 2 2\n2 3 11\n1 2 1\n2 3 12\n1 3 1\n2 3 13\n1 3 2\n2 3 14\n1 3 3\n2 3 15\n1 3 4\n2 3 16\n1 3 5\n2 3 17\n1 3 6\n2 3 18\n1 3 7\n2 4 18\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "12 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 2 0\n", "output": ["38\n1 3 11\n3 3 7\n2 3 2\n1 3 12\n3 3 8\n2 3 3\n1 2 12\n3 3 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 11\n3 4 9\n2 3 5\n1 2 10\n2 3 6\n1 2 9\n2 3 7\n1 2 8\n2 3 8\n1 2 7\n2 3 9\n1 2 6\n2 3 10\n1 2 5\n2 3 11\n1 2 4\n2 4 11\n1 2 3\n1 2 2\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 3 2\n1 3 3\n1 3 4\n1 3 5\n1 3 6\n1 3 7\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "10 20\n18 9 4 5 12 14 16 1 15 20\n11 13 16 6 18 5 20 17 4 3\n12 9 15 14 8 10 2 19 1 7\n6 11 13 2 7 19 10 3 8 17\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "15 30\n20 24 17 13 26 8 5 6 27 14 18 22 25 2 15\n4 12 6 25 3 5 28 11 15 21 9 26 7 17 13\n19 20 24 16 2 23 8 29 22 30 1 27 10 14 18\n9 29 3 7 12 28 10 16 23 19 21 1 30 11 4\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["def main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    k = int(data[idx])\n    idx += 1\n    \n    grid = []\n    for _ in range(4):\n        row = list(map(int, data[idx:idx+n]))\n        idx += n\n        grid.append(row)\n    \n    #

{"name": "2026", "description": "Yaroslav is playing a game called \"Time\". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d·dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n and d (3 ≤ n ≤ 100, 10^3 ≤ d ≤ 10^5) — the number of stations and the constant from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains n - 2 integers: a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^3). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} (-100 ≤ x_{i}, y_{i} ≤ 100).\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print an integer — the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n\nOutput\n2000\n\nInput\n3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n1000", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2026, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n", "output": ["2000\n"]}, {"input": "3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n", "output": ["2000\n"]}, {"input": "3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}, {"input": "5 1421\n896 448 727\n-19 -40\n-87 40\n69 51\n-55 61\n-7 67\n", "output": ["169099\n"]}, {"input": "6 1000\n142 712 254 869\n7 0\n95 38\n96 -20\n-7 93\n75 -45\n-80 -20\n", "output": ["107000\n"]}, {"input": "7 1288\n943 265 649 447 806\n-4 -51\n-26 32\n47 -28\n31 32\n61 65\n-45 -37\n82 42\n", "output": ["229903\n"]}, {"input": "8 1931\n440 627 324 538 539 119\n-85 -41\n-91 61\n-84 11\n92 -19\n8 -5\n16 -25\n97 -98\n91 78\n", "output": ["569018\n"]}, {"input": "9 1829\n98 513 987 291 162 637 356\n38 -3\n-89 93\n-86 45\n-43 -84\n-3 -87\n53 -59\n18 -19\n81 -74\n-85 32\n", "output": ["288982\n"]}, {"input": "10 1000\n759 222 589 423 947 507 31 414\n-4 -71\n-31 -53\n24 28\n-13 -65\n-59 -49\n-42 -79\n85 -71\n-60 -17\n28 66\n74 2\n", "output": ["151000\n"]}, {"input": "11 1199\n282 735 54 1000 419 939 901 789 128\n10 -81\n26 72\n19 -91\n-61 85\n0 -33\n-62 79\n-59 65\n-2 -77\n-63 100\n-15 53\n94 54\n", "output": ["262581\n"]}, {"input": "12 1609\n196 486 94 344 524 588 315 504 449 201\n86 -22\n-2 25\n-95 -8\n-5 -30\n-78 71\n5 -54\n-69 -92\n-41 0\n10 19\n61 17\n75 -39\n-46 22\n", "output": ["282231\n"]}, {"input": "3 97325\n40\n43 43\n45 -95\n-93 63\n", "output": ["15182700\n"]}, {"input": "11 1615\n137 681 199 33 388 585 241 518 7\n-60 89\n24 6\n-100 -55\n-26 -90\n-40 -33\n-100 28\n12 34\n-60 -13\n38 -89\n62 81\n-35 54\n", "output": ["96900\n"]}, {"input": "4 62071\n706 480\n6 96\n51 -12\n99 66\n-69 -61\n", "output": ["14400472\n"]}, {"input": "12 1542\n389 356 290 648 182 94 585 988 762 494\n-46 96\n1 88\n0 95\n-91 -100\n-42 -29\n45 -27\n-52 -34\n-62 27\n-19 46\n-100 95\n5 -55\n-36 -65\n", "output": ["263034\n"]}, {"input": "3 100000\n1\n-100 -100\n-100 -99\n100 100\n", "output": ["39999999\n"]}, {"input": "12 1211\n1 5 7 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000\n1 1\n5 5\n3 4\n4 3\n0 1\n0 2\n0 5\n0 7\n1 0\n3 0\n8 0\n10 10\n", "output": ["20220\n"]}, {"input": "6 1000\n1000 1000 1000 1000\n0 0\n0 -1\n1 -1\n2 -1\n2 0\n2 1\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["import sys\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef main():\n    input_lines = []\n    for line in sys.stdin:\n        input_lines.append(line.strip())\n    \n    line_idx = 0\n    \n    # Parse first line\n    parts = input_lines[line_idx].split()\n    line_idx += 1\n    n = int(parts[0])\n    d = int(parts[1])\n    \n    # Parse time gains\n    if n > 2:\n        a_values = list(map(int, input_lines[line_idx].split()))\n        line_idx += 1\n    else:\n        a_values = []\n    \n    # Create a array (1-indexed for stations 2 to n-1)\n    a = [0] * (n + 1)\n    for i in range(len(a_values)):\n        a[i + 2] = a_values[i]\n    \n    # Parse coordinates\n    coords = []\n    for i in range(n):\n        x, y = map(int, input_lines[line_idx].split())\n        line_idx += 1\n        coords.append((x, y))\n    \n    # Precompute distances\n    def manhattan_dist(i, j):\n        return abs(coords[i][0] -

{"name": "2159", "description": "Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ T ≤ 100) — the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ T, 1 ≤ q_{i} ≤ 1000) each — the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer — the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests.

{"name": "2066", "description": "In the official contest this problem has a different statement, for which jury's solution was working incorrectly, and for this reason it was excluded from the contest. This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n - 2). After that Vova's character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.\n\nVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line on the input contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 200 000, n is even) — the number of positions available initially.

Therefore, the total weight of Bob’s fish is always not less than the total weight of Alice’s fish.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2075, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 3 3\n2 2 2\n1 1 3\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "4 7 9\n5 2 7 3\n3 5 2 7 3 8 7\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 3 3\n2 2 2\n1 1 3\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "4 7 9\n5 2 7 3\n3 5 2 7 3 8 7\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}, {"input": "5 5 10\n8 2 8 5 9\n9 1 7 5 1\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "7 7 10\n8 2 8 10 6 9 10\n2 4 9 5 6 2 5\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "15 15 10\n4 5 9 1 4 6 4 1 4 3 7 9 9 2 6\n6 6 7 7 2 9 1 6 10 9 7 10 7 10 9\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}, {"input": "25 25 10\n10 6 2 1 9 7 2 5 6 9 2 3 2 8 5 8 2 9 10 8 9 7 7 4 8\n6 2 10 4 7 9 3 2 4 5 1 8 6 9 8 6 9 8 4 8 7 9 10 2 8\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}, {"input": "2 2 1000000000\n398981840 446967516\n477651114 577011341\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}, {"input": "1 1 1\n1\n1\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}, {"input": "1 1 1000000000\n502700350\n502700349\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "1 1 1000000000\n406009709\n406009709\n", "output": ["NO\n"]}, {"input": "2 1 1000000000\n699573624 308238132\n308238132\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "10 10 10\n2 10 8 1 10 4 6 1 3 7\n8 1 1 5 7 1 9 10 2 3\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}, {"input": "5 4 5\n1 2 2 3 4\n1 3 4 5\n", "output": ["YES\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["def solve():\n    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n    alice = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    bob = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Count frequencies\n    alice_count = Counter(alice)\n    bob_count = Counter(bob)\n    \n    # Get all unique fish types and sort them\n    all_types = sorted(set(alice + bob))\n    \n    # Calculate cumulative difference\n    diff = 0\n    for fish_type in all_types:\n        diff += alice_count.get(fish_type, 0) - bob_count.get(fish_type, 0)\n        if diff > 0:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            return\n    \n    # If we never got a positive cumulative difference, Alice cannot win\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()"], "responses": ["\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef solve():\n    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())\n    alice = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    bob = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Count frequencies\n    alice_count = Counter(alice)\n    bob_count = Counter(bob)\n    \n    # Get all unique fish types and sort them\n    all_types = sorted(set(alice + bob))\n    \n    # Calculate cumulative difference\n    diff = 0\n    for fish_type in all_types:\n        diff += alice_count.get(fish_type, 0) - bob_count.get(fish_type, 0)\n        if diff > 0:\n            print(\"YES\")\n            return\n    \n    # If we never got a positive cumulative difference, Alice cannot win\n    print(\"NO\")\n\nsolve()\n\n\n"], "prompt_tokens": [9709], "completion_tokens": [3022], "no_of_try": 1, "api_calls": 8, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2075}
{"name": "2000", "description": "Codefortia is a small island country located somewhere in the West Pacific. It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 70$, $n - 1 \\leq m \\leq 200$, $1 \\leq a < b \\leq 10^7$) — the number of settlements and gravel roads in Codefortia, and two possible travel times. Each of the following lines contains three integers $u, v, c$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$, $u \\neq v$, $c \\in \\{a, b\\}$) denoting a single gravel road between the settlements $u$ and $v$, which requires $c$ minutes to travel.\n\nYou can assume that the road network is connected and has no loops or multiedges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single line containing $n$ integers. The $p$-th of them should denote the minimum possible time required to travel from $1$ to $p$ after the selected roads are abandoned.

{"name": "2065", "description": "Andrewid the Android is a galaxy-famous detective. He is now investigating the case of vandalism at the exhibition of contemporary art.\n\nThe main exhibit is a construction of n matryoshka dolls that can be nested one into another. The matryoshka dolls are numbered from 1 to n. A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 → 2 → 4 → 5. \n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 → 2 → ... → n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5) and k (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5) — the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 ≤ m_{i} ≤ n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} — the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 → 2 and 3.

For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters. How many distinct names are there among them, if two ambiguities described above are taken into account?\n\nFormally, we assume that two words denote the same name, if using the replacements \"u\" [Image] \"oo\" and \"h\" [Image] \"kh\", you can make the words equal. One can make replacements in both directions, in any of the two words an arbitrary number of times. A letter that resulted from the previous replacement can participate in the next replacements.\n\nFor example, the following pairs of words denote the same name:  \"koouper\" and \"kuooper\". Making the replacements described above, you can make both words to be equal: \"koouper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\" and \"kuooper\" $\\rightarrow$ \"kuuper\".  \"khun\" and \"kkkhoon\".

{"name": "1604", "description": "You are at the top left cell $(1, 1)$ of an $n \\times m$ labyrinth. Your goal is to get to the bottom right cell $(n, m)$. You can only move right or down, one cell per step. Moving right from a cell $(x, y)$ takes you to the cell $(x, y + 1)$, while moving down takes you to the cell $(x + 1, y)$.\n\nSome cells of the labyrinth contain rocks. When you move to a cell with rock, the rock is pushed to the next cell in the direction you're moving. If the next cell contains a rock, it gets pushed further, and so on.\n\nThe labyrinth is surrounded by impenetrable walls, thus any move that would put you or any rock outside of the labyrinth is illegal.\n\nCount the number of different legal paths you can take from the start to the goal modulo $10^9 + 7$. Two paths are considered different if there is at least one cell that is visited in one path, but not visited in the other.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n, m$ — dimensions of the labyrinth ($1 \\leq n, m \\leq 2000$).\n\nNext $n$ lines describe the labyrinth.

In other words, if the number of videos in the $j$-th post is $s_j$ then:\n\n  $s_1+s_2+\\dots+s_k=n$ ($s_i>0$),  the first post contains the videos: $1, 2, \\dots, s_1$;  the second post contains the videos: $s_1+1, s_1+2, \\dots, s_1+s_2$;  the third post contains the videos: $s_1+s_2+1, s_1+s_2+2, \\dots, s_1+s_2+s_3$;  ...  the $k$-th post contains videos: $n-s_k+1,n-s_k+2,\\dots,n$. \n\nPolycarp is a perfectionist, he wants the total duration of videos in each post to be the same.\n\nHelp Polycarp to find such positive integer values $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$ that satisfy all the conditions above.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le k \\le n \\le 10^5$). The next line contains $n$ positive integer numbers $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$ ($1 \\le a_i \\le 10^4$), where $a_i$ is the duration of the $i$-th video.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf solution exists, print \"Yes\" in the first line. Print $k$ positive integers $s_1, s_2, \\dots, s_k$ ($s_1+s_2+\\dots+s_k=n$) in the second line. The total duration of videos in each post should be the same. It can be easily proven that the answer is unique (if it exists).\n\nIf there is no solution, print a single line \"No\".\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6 3\n3 3 1 4 1 6\n\nOutput\nYes\n2 3 1 \nInput\n3 3\n1 1 1\n\nOutput\nYes\n1 1 1 \nInput\n3 3\n1 1 2\n\nOutput\nNo\nInput\n3 1\n1 10 100\n\nOutput\nYes\n3", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2160, "sample_io": [{"input": "6 3\n3 3 1 4 1 6\n", "output": ["Yes\n2 3 1 "]}, {"input": "3 3\n1 1 1\n", "output": ["Yes\n1 1 1 "]}, {"input": "3 3\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["No"]}, {"input": "3 1\n1 10 100\n", "output": ["Yes\n3 "]}], "test_list": [{"input": "6 3\n3 3 1 4 1 6\n", "output": ["Yes\n2 3 1 "]}, {"input": "3 3\n1 1 1\n", "output": ["Yes\n1 1 1 "]}, {"input": "3 3\n1 1 2\n", "output": ["No"]}, {"input": "3 1\n1 10 100\n", "output": ["Yes\n3 "]}, {"input": "1 1\n3\n", "output": ["Yes\n1 "]}, {"input": "2 1\n1 3\n", "output": ["Yes\n2 "]}, {"input": "2 1\n3 3\n", "output": ["Yes\n2 "]}, {"input": "2 2\n3 1\n", "output": ["No"]}, {"input": "2 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["No"]}, {"input": "4 2\n2 1 3 1\n", "output": ["No"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": [""], "responses": [""], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2160}
