{"name": "3554", "description": "Zonk is addictive dice game. In each round player rolls 6 dice. Then (s)he composes combinations from them. Each combination gives certain points. \n\nThen player can take one or more dice combinations to his hand and re-roll remaining dice or save his score. Dice in player's hand won't be taken into account in subsequent rolls.\n\nIf no combinations can be composed - situation is called \"zonk\". Player thrown zonk loses all points in this round and next player moves. So it's player decision when to reroll and when to stop and save his score.\n\nYour task is simple - just evaluate current roll and return maximum number of points can be scored from it. If no combinations can be made - function must return string ``\"Zonk\"`` (without quotes).\n\nThere are different variations of Zonk. In this kata, we will use most common table of combinations:\n\nCombinationExample rollPoints\nStraight (1,2,3,4,5 and 6)6 3 1 2 5 41000 points\nThree pairs of any dice2 2 4 4 1 1750 points\nThree of 11 4 1 11000 points\nThree of 22 3 4 2 2200 points\nThree of 33 4 3 6 3 2300 points\nThree of 44 4 4400 points\nThree of 52 5 5 5 4500 points\nThree of 66 6 2 6600 points\nFour of a kind1 1 1 1 4 62 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 2000 pts)\nFive of a kind5 5 5 4 5 53 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1500 pts)\nSix of a kind4 4 4 4 4 44 \u00d7 Three-of-a-kind score (in example, 1600 pts)\nEvery 14 3 1 2 2100 points\nEvery 55 2 650 points\n\n\nEach die cannot be used in multiple combinations the same time, so three pairs of 2, 3 and 5 will worth you only ``750`` points (for three pairs), not 850 (for three pairs and two fives). But you can select multiple combinations, ``2 2 2 1 6`` will worth you ``300`` points (200 for three-of-kind '2' plus 100 for single '1' die)\n\nExamples:\n```python\n  get_score([1,2,3]) # returns 100 = points from one 1\n  get_score([3,4,1,1,5]) # returns 250 = points from two 1 and one 5\n  get_score([2,3,2,3,3,2]) # returns 500 = three of 2 + three of 3\n  get_score([1,1,1,1,1,5]) # returns 3050 = five 1 + one 5\n  get_score([2,3,4,3,6,6]) # returns \"Zonk\" = no combinations here\n  get_score([2,2,6,6,2,2]) # returns 400 = four 2, this cannot be scored as three pairs\n  get_score([1,3,4,3,4,1]) # returns 750 = three pairs\n  get_score([3,3,3,3]) # returns 600 = four of 3\n  get_score([1,2,3,4,5]) # returns 150 = it's not straight\n```\nOf course, in real Zonk game it's sometimes not worth to collect all combination from roll. Taking less dice and rerolling more remaining may be better, but task is just to calculate maximum possible score from current single roll.\n\nP.S.

The key concepts are:\n1. **Scoring Rules**: There are various combinations of dice rolls that yield specific scores. These combinations must be identified from the roll.\n2. **Greedy Approach**: To maximize the score, the algorithm needs to consider the best possible combinations without repeating dice across different combinations.\n3. **Recursive Evaluation**: Sometimes, combining multiple smaller combinations might lead to higher scores than taking one large combination. Therefore, a recursive approach is necessary to explore different possibilities.\n\n### Algorithm:\n\n1. **Count Frequencies**: First, count the frequency of each die value in the roll.\n2. **Check Straight**: Check if there is a straight (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). If found, return 1000 points.\n3. **Check Other Combinations**: Use the frequencies to check for other valid combinations like three pairs, three of a kind, etc.\n4. **Maximize Score**: Recursively try to maximize the score by either taking the current combination and rerolling or saving the current score and rolling again.\n\n### Tutorial:\n\n#### Count Frequencies\nTo count the frequency of each die value, you can use a dictionary where the keys are the die values and the values are their counts.\n\n```python\ndef count_frequencies(roll):\n    freq = {}\n    for die in roll:\n        if die in freq:\n            freq[die] += 1\n        else:\n            freq[die] = 1\n    return freq\n```\n\n#### Check for Straight\nA straight means the dice show (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). You can sort the roll and check if consecutive numbers exist.\n\n```python\ndef has_straight(roll):\n    sorted_roll = sorted(roll)\n    return sorted_roll == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n```\n\n#### Check for Three Pairs\nThree pairs mean exactly three pairs of the same dice.\n\n```python\ndef has_three_pairs(freq):\n    pairs = sum(1 for count in freq.values() if count == 2)\n    return pairs == 3\n```\n\n#### Check for Three of a Kind\nThree of a kind means at least one die shows up three times.\n\n```python\ndef has_three_of_a_kind(freq):\n    for count in freq.values():\n        if count >= 3:\n            return True\n    return False\n```\n\n#### Recursive Evaluation\nRecursively evaluate the roll to maximize the score by considering different combinations.\n\n```python\ndef max_score(roll, freq):\n    if has_straight(roll):\n        return 1000\n    \n    total_points = 0\n    \n    # Check for three pairs\n    if has_three_pairs(freq):\n        total_points += 750\n    \n    # Check for other three of a kinds\n    for die, count in freq.items():\n        if count >= 3:\n            base_points = die * 100\n            if count > 3:\n                bonus_points = base_points * (count - 3)\n            total_points += base_points + bonus_points\n    \n    # Check for every 1 and every 5\n    if freq.get(1, 0) >= 4:\n        total_points += 100\n    if freq.get(5, 0) >= 4:\n        total_points += 50\n    \n    return total_points\n```\n\n### Example Problems:\n\n1. **Problem**: [Two Sum]\n   - **Description**: Given an array of integers, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to a specific target.\n   - **Solution**: Use a hash map to store the difference between the target and each element.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def two_sum(nums, target):\n         num_map = {}\n         for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n             diff = target - num\n             if diff in num_map:\n                 return [num_map[diff], i]\n             num_map[num] = i\n     ```\n\n2. **Problem**: [Maximum Subarray]\n   - **Description**: Find the contiguous subarray within an array (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum.\n   - **Solution**: Use Kadane\u2019s Algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def max_subarray(nums):\n         max_current = max_global = nums[0]\n         for num in nums[1:]:\n             max_current = max(num, max_current + num)\n             if max_current > max_global:\n                 max_global = max_current\n         return max_global\n     ```\n\n3. **Problem**: [Longest Palindromic Substring]\n   - **Description**: Given a string, find the longest palindromic substring in it.\n   - **Solution**: Expand around the center method to check for palindromes.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def expand_around_center(s, left, right):\n         while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n             left -= 1\n             right += 1\n         return s[left + 1:right]\n     \n     def longest_palindrome(s):\n         if not s:\n             return \"\"\n         longest = \"\"\n         for i in range(len(s)):\n             odd = expand_around_center(s, i, i)\n             even = expand_around_center(s, i, i + 1)\n             longest = max(longest, odd, even, key=len)\n         return longest\n     ```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n```python\ndef get_score(roll):\n    freq = count_frequencies(roll)\n    \n    if has_straight(roll):\n        return 1000\n    \n    total_points = 0\n    \n    # Check for three pairs\n    if has_three_pairs(freq):\n        total_points += 750\n    \n    # Check for other three of a kinds\n    for die, count in freq.items():\n        if count >= 3:\n            base_points = die * 100\n            if count > 3:\n                bonus_points = base_points * (count - 3)\n            total_points += base_points + bonus_points\n    \n    # Check for every 1 and every 5\n    if freq.get(1, 0) >= 4:\n        total_points += 100\n    if freq.get(5, 0) >= 4:\n        total_points += 50\n    \n    return total_points if total_points > 0 else \"Zonk\"\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    roll = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    print(get_score(roll))\n```\n\nThis code defines functions to count frequencies, check for straights and other combinations, and recursively evaluate the roll to maximize the score.

The key algorithm here is string manipulation and conditional logic:\n\n1. **String Splitting**: Breaking down the input string into individual words.\n2. **String Manipulation**: Modifying each word according to its length and position.\n3. **Conditional Logic**: Deciding whether to capitalize the first character of a word or leave it unchanged.\n\n### Tutorial: String Manipulation and Conditional Logic\n\n#### String Splitting\nIn Python, we can split a string into a list of words using the `split()` method. By default, `split()` splits the string at whitespace.\n\n```python\nwords = \"apple of banana\".split()  # ['apple', 'of', 'banana']\n```\n\n#### String Manipulation\nTo manipulate strings, we use slicing (`word[:1]` for the first character and `word[1:]` for the rest). We can also use the `upper()` and `lower()` methods to convert characters to uppercase or lowercase.\n\n```python\nword = \"apple\"\nfirst_char = word.upper()\nrest_of_word = word.lower()[1:]\nprint(first_char + rest_of_word)  # 'Apple'\n```\n\n#### Conditional Logic\nWe need to check if the word length is greater than 2 before capitalizing the first character.\n\n```python\nif len(word) > 2:\n    modified_word = first_char + rest_of_word\nelse:\n    modified_word = word\n```\n\n### Example Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: Reverse Words in a Sentence\nGiven a sentence, reverse each word in the sentence while keeping the order of the words intact.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Split the sentence into words.\n2. Reverse each word individually.\n3. Join the reversed words back into a sentence.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(sentence):\n    words = sentence.split()\n    reversed_words = [word[::-1] for word in words]\n    return ' '.join(reversed_words)\n\n# Test\nsentence = \"hello world\"\nprint(reverse_words(sentence))  # \"olleh dlrow\"\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Remove Duplicates From a List\nGiven a list of elements, remove duplicate elements while maintaining the original order.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Use an empty list to store unique elements.\n2. Iterate through the list and add elements to the new list only if they are not already present.\n\n```python\ndef remove_duplicates(lst):\n    unique_elements = []\n    for item in lst:\n        if item not in unique_elements:\n            unique_elements.append(item)\n    return unique_elements\n\n# Test\nlst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]\nprint(remove_duplicates(lst))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Count Vowels in a String\nGiven a string, count the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u).\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Define a set of vowels.\n2. Iterate through the string and count the vowels.\n\n```python\ndef count_vowels(s):\n    vowels = set(\"aeiouAEIOU\")\n    count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if char in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Test\ns = \"Hello World\"\nprint(count_vowels(s))  # 3\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n#### Solution Explanation\n1.

In a decimal system (base 10), each place represents a power of 10. Starting from the rightmost digit, which is the units place, we move leftward and multiply each successive place by 10.\n\nFor example:\n- The number 732 can be broken down as follows:\n  - \\(2\\) is in the units place (\\(2 \\times 10^0 = 2\\))\n  - \\(3\\) is in the tens place (\\(3 \\times 10^1 = 30\\))\n  - \\(7\\) is in the hundreds place (\\(7 \\times 10^2 = 700\\))\n\nSo, \\(732 = 2 + 30 + 700\\).\n\n### Constructing the Expanded Form:\nTo construct the expanded form of a number:\n1.

This gives the largest power of 10 less than \\(n\\).\n\n```python\ndef largest_power_of_10_less_than_n(n):\n    power = 1\n    while power * 10 < n:\n        power *= 10\n    return power\n\nprint(largest_power_of_10_less_than_n(789))  # Output: 100\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n1.

In a substitution cipher, each character in the plaintext is replaced by another character according to a fixed rule. This means that if two characters in the plaintext are the same, they must map to the same character in the ciphertext, and vice versa.\n\nTo determine if two strings can be transformed into each other using a substitution cipher, we need to ensure that the frequency and order of characters in both strings match up correctly under any potential mapping.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n### Understanding Substitution Ciphers:\nA substitution cipher is a type of encryption technique where each character in the plaintext is replaced by a character in the ciphertext. The substitution is consistent throughout the entire message, meaning the same plaintext character always maps to the same ciphertext character.\n\n### Frequency Analysis:\nOne way to analyze the consistency of a substitution cipher is through frequency analysis. By comparing the frequency distribution of characters in both the plaintext and ciphertext, we can identify patterns that suggest the use of a substitution cipher. However, for this specific problem, we don't actually need to perform frequency analysis; instead, we focus on ensuring that the relative order and count of characters match.\n\n### Mapping Characters:\nTo solve this problem, we need to establish a one-to-one mapping between the characters of the two strings. We can do this by iterating through both strings simultaneously and checking if the characters at corresponding positions have already been mapped. If not, we create a new mapping. If they have been mapped but do not correspond, we return `False`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: [UVa 10147: Cryptography]\n**Problem Description:** Given two strings, determine if there exists a one-to-one mapping between their characters such that each character in the first string can be substituted to form the second string.\n\n**Solution Approach:** Use a dictionary to keep track of the mappings and ensure no conflicts occur.\n\n```python\ndef is_cryptography_possible(string1, string2):\n    char_map = {}\n    reverse_map = {}\n\n    for char1, char2 in zip(string1, string2):\n        if char1 in char_map:\n            if char_map[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            char_map[char1] = char2\n\n        if char2 in reverse_map:\n            if reverse_map[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            reverse_map[char2] = char1\n\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_cryptography_possible(\"aacb\", \"aabc\"))  # True\nprint(is_cryptography_possible(\"aa\", \"bc\"))      # False\n```\n\n### Problem 2: [HackerRank Sherlock and Anagrams]\n**Problem Description:** Determine if two strings are anagrams of each other by comparing sorted versions of the strings.\n\n**Solution Approach:** Sort both strings and compare them directly.\n\n```python\ndef are_anagrams(string1, string2):\n    return sorted(string1) == sorted(string2)\n\n# Example usage\nprint(are_anagrams(\"silent\", \"listen\"))  # True\nprint(are_anagrams(\"hello\", \"world\"))    # False\n```\n\n### Problem 3: [LeetCode 205. Isomorphic Strings]\n**Problem Description:** Check if two strings are isomorphic, meaning each character in the first string can be replaced to get the second string.\n\n**Solution Approach:** Use dictionaries to map characters from both strings and ensure consistency.\n\n```python\ndef are_isomorphic(string1, string2):\n    char_map = {}\n    reverse_map = {}\n\n    for char1, char2 in zip(string1, string2):\n        if char1 in char_map:\n            if char_map[char1] != char2:\n                return False\n        else:\n            char_map[char1] = char2\n\n        if char2 in reverse_map:\n            if reverse_map[char2] != char1:\n                return False\n        else:\n            reverse_map[char2] = char1\n\n    return True\n\n# Example usage\nprint(are_isomorphic(\"egg\", \"add\"))  # True\nprint(are_isomorphic(\"foo\", \"bar\"))  # False\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\nWe create two dictionaries, `char_map` and `reverse_map`, to store the mappings between characters in `string1` and `string2`. As we iterate through both strings, we check if the current characters already have established mappings. If they do, we verify that the existing mappings are consistent. If at any point the mappings conflict, we return `False`.

A palindrome reads the same backward as forward.\n    - **Solution**: Compare the original string with its reverse (`str[::-1]`).\n    - **Code**:\n      ```python\n      def is_palindrome(word):\n          return word == word[::-1]\n      \n      # Sample input\n      word = input().lower()\n      print(is_palindrome(word))\n      ```\n\n3. **URL Validator**:\n    - **Problem**: Write a function to validate a URL. A simple validation rule could be to check if the URL starts with 'http://' or 'https://'.\n    - **Solution**: Use string methods like `startswith()` to check the protocol part of the URL.\n    - **Code**:\n      ```python\n      def is_valid_url(url):\n          return url.startswith('http://') or url.startswith('https://')\n      \n      # Sample input\n      url = input()\n      print(is_valid_url(url))\n      ```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n#### Explanation of the Solution:\n1. Read the input string.\n2. Check if the length of the string is either 4 or 6.\n3. Verify if all characters in the string are digits using the `isdigit()` method.\n4. Return `True` if both conditions are met; otherwise, return `False`.\n\n#### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef validate_pin(pin):\n    if len(pin) == 4 or len(pin) == 6:\n        return pin.isdigit()\n    return False\n\n# Sample input\npin = input()\nprint(validate_pin(pin))\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that the PIN is validated according to the specified criteria, returning `True` if it meets the requirements and `False` otherwise."], "prompt_tokens": [341], "completion_tokens": [736], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 4440}

The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:\n\n- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)\n- F(1) = 1\n- F(2) = 1\n\nTo avoid calculating large Fibonacci numbers, we can observe that the last digits of Fibonacci numbers repeat every 60 numbers (the Pisano period). Therefore, instead of calculating the nth Fibonacci number directly, we can calculate the (n % 60)th Fibonacci number and then get its last digit.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### What is the Pisano Period?\nThe Pisano period is a sequence of integers that appears when considering the remainders of successive Fibonacci numbers divided by n. It's named after Leonardo Fibonacci who introduced the Fibonacci sequence. \n\nFor example, let's consider the remainder of the Fibonacci numbers divided by 10 (to get the last digit):\n0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 0, 9, 9, 8, 7, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 5, 1, 6, 7, 3, 0, 3, 3, 6, 9, 5, 4, 9, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, ...\n\nAs you can see, the sequence starts repeating after 60 terms: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 1, 5, 6, 1, 7, 8, 5, 3, 8, 1, 9, 0, 9, 9, 8, 7, 5, 2, 7, 9, 6, 5, 1, 6, 7, 3, 0, 3, 3, 6, 9, 5, 4, 9, 3, 2, 5, 7, 2, 9, 1, 0, 1, 1, ...\n\nThis repeating pattern is known as the Pisano period.\n\n### How do we use the Pisano period?\nGiven a number n, we want to find the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number. To do this, we can first find the position in the repeating pattern by taking n modulo the length of the Pisano period (which is 60 for base 10). Then, we can look up the corresponding value in the repeating pattern.\n\nFor example, if n = 100, we would calculate 100 % 60 = 40. This means that the last digit of the 100th Fibonacci number is the same as the last digit of the 40th Fibonacci number. We can look up the 40th term in our repeating pattern and see that the last digit is 5.\n\n## Example Problems:\n### Problem 1: Find the nth Fibonacci number\nThis is the classic Fibonacci sequence problem where you need to calculate the nth Fibonacci number.\n\nSolution: Use dynamic programming to store previously calculated Fibonacci numbers.\n\nPython Code:\n```python\ndef fibonacci(n):\n    fibs = [0] * (n+1)\n    fibs[1], fibs[2] = 1, 1\n    for i in range(3, n+1):\n        fibs[i] = (fibs[i-1] + fibs[i-2]) % 10\n    return fibs[n]\n\n# Get input from user\nn = int(input())\nprint(fibonacci(n))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Calculate the sum of two large Fibonacci numbers\nThis problem requires adding two large Fibonacci numbers. Since they can be very large, we use modular arithmetic to keep the numbers small.\n\nSolution: Use an iterative approach to add the two numbers.\n\nPython Code:\n```python\ndef fibonacci_sum(n, m):\n    def fib_mod(n, mod):\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for _ in range(n):\n            a, b = b, (a + b) % mod\n        return a\n    \n    return (fib_mod(n, 10) + fib_mod(m, 10)) % 10\n\n# Get input from user\nn, m = map(int, input().split())\nprint(fibonacci_sum(n, m))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Find the last digit of the product of two Fibonacci numbers\nThis problem requires multiplying two Fibonacci numbers and returning the last digit.\n\nSolution: Use the property that the last digit of a product depends only on the last digits of the factors.\n\nPython Code:\n```python\ndef last_digit_of_product(a, b):\n    last_digits = [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 3, 1, 4, 5, 9, 4, 3, 7, 0, 7, 7, 4, 1]\n    \n    # Find the positions in the repeating pattern\n    pos_a = a % 60\n    pos_b = b % 60\n    \n    # Calculate the product of the last digits\n    product_last_digit = last_digits[pos_a] * last_digits[pos_b]\n    \n    # Return the last digit of the product\n    return product_last_digit % 10\n\n# Get input from user\na, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(last_digit_of_product(a, b))\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Solution:\nWe use the idea of finding the position in the repeating pattern using the Pisano period to calculate the last digit of the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef last_fib_digit(n):\n    # Pisano period for base 10 is 60\n    pisano_period = [0] * 60\n    pisano_period[1], pisano_period[2] = 1, 1\n    for i in range(3, 60):\n        pisano_period[i] = (pisano_period[i-1] + pisano_period[i-2]) % 10\n    \n    # Find the position in the repeating pattern\n    position = n % 60\n    \n    # Return the last digit of the Fibonacci number at that position\n    return pisano_period[position]\n\n# Get input from user\nn = int(input())\nprint(last_fib_digit(n))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [471], "completion_tokens": [1515], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3512}

Otherwise, if scores are equal, it's a draw.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Simple Battle\n**Problem**: Implement a function to compare two strings representing battles where each character represents a soldier.\n- **Solution**: Parse both strings, count soldiers, and compare counts.\n```python\ndef simple_battle(str1, str2):\n    count1 = str1.count('x') + str1.count('o')\n    count2 = str2.count('x') + str2.count('o')\n    return \"First\" if count1 > count2 else \"Second\"\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Advanced Battle\n**Problem**: Extend the above to include special characters that can affect the number of soldiers.\n- **Solution**: Parse string, apply rules for special characters, and count soldiers.\n```python\ndef advanced_battle(str1, str2):\n    # Define rules for special characters\n    rules = {'*': lambda x: x*2, '#': lambda x: x/2}\n    # Apply rules and count soldiers\n    def count_soldiers(s):\n        result = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if char == 'x':\n                result += 1\n            elif char == 'o':\n                result -= 1\n            elif char in rules:\n                result = rules[char](result)\n        return abs(result)\n    \n    count1, count2 = count_soldiers(str1), count_soldiers(str2)\n    return \"First\" if count1 > count2 else \"Second\"\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Bomb Impact Battle\n**Problem**: Similar to the original problem but focus on determining the impact of bombs on battle outcomes.\n- **Solution**: Parse string, apply bomb explosion logic, and calculate scores.\n```python\ndef bomb_impact_battle(str1):\n    # Remove bombs and adjacent characters\n    result = []\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(str1):\n        if str1[i] == '*':\n            i += 2  # Skip next character as well\n        else:\n            result.append(str1[i])\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Calculate scores\n    left_score = sum(4 if c == 'w' else 3 if c == 'p' else 2 if c == 'b' else 1 if c == 's' else 0 for c in result if c.isalpha())\n    right_score = sum(4 if c == 'm' else 3 if c == 'q' else 2 if c == 'd' else 1 if c == 'z' else 0 for c in result if c.isalpha())\n    \n    # Determine winner\n    if left_score > right_score:\n        return \"Left side wins!\"\n    elif right_score > left_score:\n        return \"Right side wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Let's fight again!\"\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n```python\ndef alphabet_war(fight):\n    # Define mappings for sides and their corresponding powers\n    left_side = {'w': 4, 'p': 3, 'b': 2, 's': 1}\n    right_side = {'m': 4, 'q': 3, 'd': 2, 'z': 1}\n    \n    # Initialize scores\n    left_score = 0\n    right_score = 0\n    \n    # Process the string\n    i = 0\n    while i < len(fight):\n        char = fight[i]\n        if char == '*':\n            # Handle bomb\n            if i > 0:\n                left_score -= left_side.get(fight[i-1], 0) if fight[i-1] in left_side else 0\n                right_score -= right_side.get(fight[i-1], 0) if fight[i-1] in right_side else 0\n            if i + 1 < len(fight):\n                left_score -= left_side.get(fight[i+1], 0) if fight[i+1] in left_side else 0\n                right_score -= right_side.get(fight[i+1], 0) if fight[i+1] in right_side else 0\n            i += 2\n        elif char in left_side:\n            left_score += left_side[char]\n            i += 1\n        elif char in right_side:\n            right_score += right_side[char]\n            i += 1\n        else:\n            i += 1\n    \n    # Determine the winner\n    if left_score > right_score:\n        return \"Left side wins!\"\n    elif right_score > left_score:\n        return \"Right side wins!\"\n    else:\n        return \"Let's fight again!\"\n\n# Get input from standard input\nfight = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function and print the output\nprint(alphabet_war(fight))\n```\n\nThis solution follows the provided guidelines, including parsing the input string, handling bomb explosions, calculating scores, and determining the winner.

It iterates through the main string and looks for the substring starting from each character until it finds a match or exhausts the main string.\n\n### Why Use this Algorithm?\n1. **Efficiency:** The algorithm is efficient for checking if one string is a part of another, especially when the lengths of both strings are known.\n2. **Case Insensitivity:** By converting both strings to lowercase (or uppercase), the search becomes case-insensitive, addressing the requirement mentioned in the problem.\n3. **Order Preservation:** The algorithm ensures that the characters in the substring appear in the same order as they do in the main string, meeting the criteria of the task.\n\n## Tutorial on Substring Search:\n\nTo implement a substring search algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. Convert both the main string (`str`) and the substring (`name`) to lowercase to ensure the search is case-insensitive.\n2. Initialize pointers or counters for both the main string and the substring.\n3. Iterate through the main string, checking if the current character matches the current character of the substring.\n4. If a match is found, move to the next character in both the main string and the substring.\n5. If a mismatch occurs, reset the pointer for the substring to the start and continue iterating from the next character in the main string.\n6. If the entire substring is matched successfully (i.e., the pointer reaches the end of the substring), return `true`.\n7. If the end of the main string is reached without finding the substring, return `false`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Check if a Word is a Substring\n**Problem Description:** Write a function to check if a word is present in a sentence.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**\n- Convert both the sentence and the word to lowercase.\n- Use a loop to iterate through the sentence and compare characters.\n- Return `true` if the word is fully matched, otherwise return `false`.\n\n```python\ndef is_word_substring(sentence, word):\n    sentence = sentence.lower()\n    word = word.lower()\n    if word in sentence:\n        return True\n    else:\n        return False\n\n# Test the function\nsentence = \"hello world\"\nword = \"world\"\nprint(is_word_substring(sentence, word))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Find the First Occurrence of a Substring\n**Problem Description:** Write a function to find the first occurrence of a substring in a string.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**\n- Convert both the main string and the substring to lowercase.\n- Use a nested loop to compare characters and find the first matching position.\n- Return the index of the first occurrence or -1 if not found.\n\n```python\ndef find_first_occurrence(main_string, substring):\n    main_string = main_string.lower()\n    substring = substring.lower()\n    for i in range(len(main_string)):\n        if main_string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:\n            return i\n    return -1\n\n# Test the function\nmain_string = \"programming is fun\"\nsubstring = \"is\"\nprint(find_first_occurrence(main_string, substring))  # Output: 8\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Count the Number of Times a Substring Appears in a String\n**Problem Description:** Write a function to count how many times a substring appears in a string.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**\n- Convert both the main string and the substring to lowercase.\n- Use a counter to keep track of occurrences.\n- Loop through the main string and increment the counter each time the substring is found.\n\n```python\ndef count_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring):\n    main_string = main_string.lower()\n    substring = substring.lower()\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(main_string)):\n        if main_string[i:i+len(substring)] == substring:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Test the function\nmain_string = \"hello hello world\"\nsubstring = \"hello\"\nprint(count_substring_occurrences(main_string, substring))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n### Solution Explanation:\n- Convert both the input string and the name to lowercase to handle case insensitivity.\n- Initialize a pointer for the name.\n- Iterate through the input string, checking if the current character matches the character at the current position in the name pointer.\n- Move the name pointer forward if there's a match.\n- If the end of the name pointer is reached, return `true` indicating that the name is found in the string.\n- If the end of the input string is reached before the name pointer, return `false`.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef nameInStr(str, name):\n    str = str.lower()\n    name = name.lower()\n    \n    name_pointer = 0\n    \n    for char in str:\n        if char == name[name_pointer]:\n            name_pointer += 1\n            if name_pointer == len(name):\n                return True\n    \n    return False\n\n# Take input from standard input\nstr_input = input().strip()\nname_input = input().strip()\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = nameInStr(str_input, name_input)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the substring search algorithm to determine if the name is contained within the input string in the required order and case-insensitively."], "prompt_tokens": [599], "completion_tokens": [1131], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3387}

If one list of creatures is longer than the other, those creatures are considered unblocked, and do not battle.\n\nYour function should return an object (a hash in Ruby) with the keys player1 and player2 that contain the power and toughness of the surviving creatures.\n\nExample:\n```\nGood luck with your battles!\n\n\nCheck out my other Magic The Gathering katas:\n\n\nMagic The Gathering #1: Creatures\nMagic The Gathering #2: Mana", "difficulty": "introductory", "id": 3478, "sample_io": [], "test_list": [{"input": "[[2, 3], [1, 4]]\n[[3, 3], [4, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[3, 3]]}]}, {"input": "[]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1]]\n[[1, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 1]]\n[[2, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 2]]\n[[1, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 2]], "player2": [[1, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 3]]\n[[3, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[2, 7]]\n[[3, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[2, 7]], "player2": [[3, 5]]}]}, {"input": "[[2, 5]]\n[[6, 6]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[6, 6]]}]}, {"input": "[[6, 6]]\n[[2, 5]]", "output": [{"player1": [[6, 6]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[]\n[[1, 1], [2, 2]]", "output": [{"player1": [], "player2": [[1, 1], [2, 2]]}]}, {"input": "[[1, 1], [2, 2]]\n[]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 1], [2, 2]], "player2": []}]}, {"input": "[[1, 3], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5, 2]]\n[[2, 4], [6, 1], [4, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]", "output": [{"player1": [[1, 3], [4, 6]], "player2": [[2, 4], [3, 7], [3, 1]]}]}], "starter_code": "\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    result = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    \n    min_length = min(len(player1), len(player2))\n    \n    for i in range(min_length):\n        p1_power, p1_toughness = player1[i]\n        p2_power, p2_toughness = player2[i]\n        \n        p1_damage = min(p1_power, p2_toughness)\n        p2_damage = min(p2_power, p1_toughness)\n        \n        p1_toughness -= p2_damage\n        p2_toughness -= p1_damage\n        \n        if p1_toughness > 0:\n            result['player1'].append([p1_power, p1_toughness])\n        if p2_toughness > 0:\n            result['player2'].append([p2_power, p2_toughness])\n    \n    if len(player1) > min_length:\n        result['player1'] += player1[min_length:]\n    if len(player2) > min_length:\n        result['player2'] += player2[min_length:]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    player1 = eval(input(\"Enter player1's creatures: \"))\n    player2 = eval(input(\"Enter player2's creatures: \"))\n    result = battle(player1, player2)\n    print(result)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["### Core Concepts and Algorithms\nThe core concept here involves simulating combat between pairs of creatures based on their power and toughness values. The algorithm requires iterating through both lists of creatures simultaneously, comparing their power and toughness to determine if they survive the battle. This involves simple arithmetic operations and conditional checks.\n\n### Tutorial\n#### Iteration and Conditionals\nTo solve this problem, you need to use basic iteration techniques such as loops and conditional statements. Here\u2019s how you can break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing variables to keep track of the remaining creatures for each player.\n2. **Pairwise Comparison**: Iterate through the lists of creatures, comparing each pair of corresponding creatures.\n3. **Battle Logic**: Calculate the damage dealt between the two creatures and update their toughness accordingly. If a creature's toughness is reduced to zero or below, it is removed from the list.\n4. **Handling Uneven Lists**: If one list is shorter than the other, simply append the remaining creatures to the result list without further battles.\n\n### Example Problems\n#### Problem 1: Array Pair Sum\n**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers, find all unique pairs of numbers whose sum equals a specific target number.\n**Solution**: Use a set to store complements and iterate through the array to check if the complement exists.\n```python\ndef find_pairs(arr, target):\n    seen = set()\n    pairs = set()\n    for num in arr:\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:\n            pairs.add((min(num, complement), max(num, complement)))\n        seen.add(num)\n    return list(pairs)\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Longest Consecutive Sequence\n**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.\n**Solution**: Sort the array and iterate through it to count consecutive sequences.\n```python\ndef longest_consecutive(nums):\n    nums.sort()\n    longest_streak = 0\n    current_streak = 1\n    for i in range(1, len(nums)):\n        if nums[i] != nums[i-1]:\n            if nums[i] == nums[i-1] + 1:\n                current_streak += 1\n            else:\n                longest_streak = max(longest_streak, current_streak)\n                current_streak = 1\n    return max(longest_streak, current_streak)\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Valid Parentheses\n**Problem Description**: Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.\n**Solution**: Use a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensure they match closing brackets correctly.\n```python\ndef is_valid(s):\n    stack = []\n    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in mapping.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in mapping:\n            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n        else:\n            return False\n    return not stack\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n#### Explanation of the Solution\n1.

Compare the power and toughness of each pair of creatures.\n4. Update the toughness of each creature based on the battle outcome.\n5. Append surviving creatures to the appropriate list.\n6. Return the final state of both players as a dictionary.\n\n#### Python3 Code\n```python\ndef battle(player1, player2):\n    result = {'player1': [], 'player2': []}\n    \n    min_length = min(len(player1), len(player2))\n    \n    for i in range(min_length):\n        p1_power, p1_toughness = player1[i]\n        p2_power, p2_toughness = player2[i]\n        \n        p1_damage = min(p1_power, p2_toughness)\n        p2_damage = min(p2_power, p1_toughness)\n        \n        p1_toughness -= p2_damage\n        p2_toughness -= p1_damage\n        \n        if p1_toughness > 0:\n            result['player1'].append([p1_power, p1_toughness])\n        if p2_toughness > 0:\n            result['player2'].append([p2_power, p2_toughness])\n    \n    if len(player1) > min_length:\n        result['player1'] += player1[min_length:]\n    if len(player2) > min_length:\n        result['player2'] += player2[min_length:]\n    \n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    player1 = eval(input(\"Enter player1's creatures: \"))\n    player2 = eval(input(\"Enter player2's creatures: \"))\n    result = battle(player1, player2)\n    print(result)\n```\n\nThis code reads the input as two lists of creatures and outputs the surviving creatures after the battle."], "prompt_tokens": [630], "completion_tokens": [1055], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3478}

It takes two arguments: the substring to be replaced and the substring to replace it with.\n```python\ntext = \"hello world\"\nnew_text = text.replace(\"world\", \"universe\")  # new_text will be \"hello universe\"\n```\n\n### Summation and Difference Calculation\nTo sum the digits in a string, you can iterate over each character, check if it is a digit, and add its numeric value to the total.\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(text):\n    total = 0\n    for char in text:\n        if char.isdigit():\n            total += int(char)\n    return total\n```\n\n## Example Problems:\n### Problem 1: Convert String to ASCII and Replace Characters\n**Problem:** Given a string, convert each character to its ASCII value and replace all instances of `8` with `9`.\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef process_string(s):\n    total1 = ''.join(str(ord(c)) for c in s)\n    total2 = total1.replace('8', '9')\n    return abs(sum(map(int, total1)) - sum(map(int, total2)))\n\n# Test case\ns = \"abc\"\nprint(process_string(s))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Calculate ASCII Sum Difference\n**Problem:** Given a string, convert each character to ASCII, replace `7` with `1`, and find the absolute difference between the sum of digits in both representations.\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef ascii_difference(s):\n    total1 = ''.join(str(ord(c)) for c in s)\n    total2 = total1.replace('7', '1')\n    return abs(sum(map(int, total1)) - sum(map(int, total2)))\n\n# Test case\ns = \"ABC\"\nprint(ascii_difference(s))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Problem 3: String ASCII Transformation\n**Problem:** Given a string, transform it by replacing each character with its ASCII value, replacing `4` with `5`, and then finding the difference between the sums of digits.\n**Solution:**\n```python\ndef ascii_transform(s):\n    total1 = ''.join(str(ord(c)) for c in s)\n    total2 = total1.replace('4', '5')\n    return abs(sum(map(int, total1)) - sum(map(int, total2)))\n\n# Test case\ns = \"XYZ\"\nprint(ascii_transform(s))  # Output: 0\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n1. **Convert the string to ASCII values:** Use `ord()` inside a list comprehension to get the ASCII values of each character.\n2. **Join the ASCII values:** Combine these values into a single string `total1`.\n3. **Replace `7` with `1`:** Use the `replace()` method to create `total2`.\n4. **Calculate the sums:** Use a helper function to compute the sum of digits in `total1` and `total2`.\n5. **Compute the difference:** Find the absolute difference between the two sums.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef sum_of_digits(text):\n    return sum(map(int, text))\n\ndef ascii_difference(s):\n    total1 = ''.join(str(ord(c)) for c in s)\n    total2 = total1.replace('7', '1')\n    return abs(sum_of_digits(total1) - sum_of_digits(total2))\n\n# Take input from standard input\ns = input()\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(ascii_difference(s))\n```\n\nThis code follows the guidelines provided and includes a detailed explanation of the algorithm, example problems, and the final solution to the original problem."], "prompt_tokens": [440], "completion_tokens": [989], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3292}
