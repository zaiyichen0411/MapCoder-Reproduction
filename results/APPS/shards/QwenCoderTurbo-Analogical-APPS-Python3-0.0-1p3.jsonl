The most efficient way to do this is to use the formula for the sum of the first n natural numbers and subtract the sum of the given list from it. This approach works because if all numbers were present, their sum would match the expected sum, but since one number is missing, the actual sum will be less than the expected sum, and the difference will be the missing number.\n\n### Tutorial:\n#### Sum of First N Natural Numbers:\nThe sum of the first n natural numbers is given by the formula \\( S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\). This formula helps us calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n.\n\n#### Finding the Missing Number:\nBy calculating the expected sum using the formula above and subtracting the actual sum of the given list, we get the missing number. This method ensures that even if the list is shuffled, we can still correctly identify the missing number efficiently.\n\n### Example Problems:\n#### Problem 1: Missing Number in an Array\n**Problem Description:** Given an array containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n, find the one that is missing from the array.\n\n**Solution Explanation:** Use the same logic as before. Calculate the expected sum of numbers from 0 to n using the formula \\( S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\) and subtract the sum of the elements in the array.\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(arr)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n\n# Example usage\narr = [3, 0, 1]\nprint(find_missing_number(arr))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Find the Duplicate Number\n**Problem Description:** Given an array nums containing n + 1 integers where each integer is between 1 and n (inclusive), prove that at least one duplicate number must exist. Assume that there is only one duplicate number, find the duplicate one.\n\n**Solution Explanation:** While this problem is different, it also involves finding a discrepancy in a sequence. One common approach is to use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare algorithm, which involves two pointers moving through the sequence at different speeds to detect a cycle.\n\n```python\ndef find_duplicate(nums):\n    slow = fast = nums[0]\n    while True:\n        slow = nums[slow]\n        fast = nums[nums[fast]]\n        if slow == fast:\n            break\n    \n    slow = nums[0]\n    while slow != fast:\n        slow = nums[slow]\n        fast = nums[fast]\n    \n    return slow\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]\nprint(find_duplicate(nums))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: First Missing Positive\n**Problem Description:** Given an unsorted integer array, find the smallest missing positive integer.\n\n**Solution Explanation:** This problem requires identifying the first gap in the sequence of positive integers. A common approach involves rearranging the elements so that each element i is placed at index i-1 if possible. After rearrangement, the first position where the condition is not met indicates the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef first_missing_positive(nums):\n    n = len(nums)\n    for i in range(n):\n        while 1 <= nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:\n            nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        if nums[i] != i + 1:\n            return i + 1\n    \n    return n + 1\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]\nprint(first_missing_positive(nums))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n**Explanation of the Solution:** We calculate the expected sum of numbers from 1 to n using the formula \\( S = \\frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \\) and subtract the sum of the given list from it. The result is the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef find_missing_number(zoo_numbers):\n    n = len(zoo_numbers) + 1\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    actual_sum = sum(zoo_numbers)\n    return expected_sum - actual_sum\n\n# Example usage\nzoo_numbers = [1, 2, 3]\nmissing_number = find_missing_number(zoo_numbers)\nprint(missing_number)  # Output: 4\n```\n\nThis solution is efficient with a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1).

The allowed operations are incrementing by 1 (`num += 1`) and doubling the number (`num *= 2`). This can be solved using dynamic programming or breadth-first search (BFS).\n\n#### Dynamic Programming Approach:\n1. **Initialization**: Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of operations needed to reach `i`.\n2. **Base Case**: `dp[1] = 0` because no operations are needed to start at 1.\n3. **Filling the DP Array**:\n   - For each number `i` from 2 to `n`, calculate the minimum steps required by considering both possible operations:\n     - Incrementing from `i-1`: `dp[i-1] + 1`\n     - Doubling from `i//2`: `dp[i//2] + 1` if `i` is even\n4. **Result**: The value `dp[n]` will give the minimum number of steps required to reach `n`.\n\n#### Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:\n1. **Initialization**: Use a queue for BFS and a set to keep track of visited numbers.\n2. **Start Node**: Begin with the node 1.\n3. **BFS Loop**:\n   - Dequeue a node `current`.\n   - If `current` is equal to `n`, return the number of steps taken to reach `n`.\n   - Otherwise, enqueue the nodes resulting from the two operations (`current + 1` and `current * 2`), ensuring they haven't been visited before.\n4. **Result**: When the target node `n` is reached, the number of steps is the answer.\n\n### Tutorial\n\nBoth approaches are valid, but the BFS approach is more intuitive for this problem due to its nature of exploring all possible paths level-by-level. Here's why BFS works well:\n\n- **Level Order Traversal**: BFS explores all nodes at the current depth before moving to nodes at the next depth. This ensures that we find the shortest path first.\n- **No Need for Backtracking**: Unlike some other graph problems where backtracking might be necessary, BFS naturally finds the shortest path in unweighted graphs like this one.\n\n### Example Problems\n\n1. **Problem**: [Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero]\n   - **Solution**: Similar to our problem, use BFS or DP to find the minimum operations to reduce `x` to zero by decrementing or dividing by 2.\n   \n2. **Problem**: [Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram]\n   - **Solution**: Count the frequency of characters in both strings and use a greedy approach to balance them, which can be seen as a variation of our problem.\n   \n3. **Problem**: [Find Minimum Steps to Convert String A to B]\n   - **Solution**: Use BFS to explore all possible transformations from string A to B with allowed operations like appending a character, deleting a character, or replacing a character.\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n```python\ndef min_steps(num):\n    # Initialize a list to store the minimum steps to reach each number\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (num + 1)\n    dp[1] = 0\n    \n    # Fill the dp array\n    for i in range(2, num + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i // 2] + 1)\n    \n    return dp[num]\n\n# Read input from standard input\nnum = int(input().strip())\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(min_steps(num))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Solution\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a list `dp` with size `num + 1` filled with infinity, except for `dp[1]` which is set to 0.\n2. **Filling the DP Array**: We iterate from 2 to `num` and update `dp[i]` based on the minimum steps required to reach `i` from `i-1` or `i//2` (if `i` is even).\n3. **Return Result**: Finally, we return `dp[num]`, which contains the minimum number of steps required to reach the given number `num`.\n\nThis solution efficiently computes the minimum steps using dynamic programming, ensuring optimal performance even for larger values of `num` up to 10,000."], "prompt_tokens": [556], "completion_tokens": [961], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 4453}

We need to determine if two given square pieces can fit into a rectangular container based on their respective dimensions.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Checking Dimensions and Constraints\nWhen dealing with problems involving dimensions, it's crucial to understand how different objects (in this case, squares and a rectangle) interact with one another. The key steps involve:\n\n1. **Understand the Inputs**: Identify what values are being provided and what they represent.\n   - `a` and `b` are the sizes of the two squares.\n   - `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the suitcase (length and width).\n\n2. **Constraints**: Determine under what conditions the squares can fit inside the suitcase.\n   - The squares can rotate within the suitcase, so we need to check all possible orientations.\n   \n3. **Implementation**: Write the logic to check if the squares can fit in any orientation.\n\n### Steps for Solution:\n- Check if both squares can fit along the length and width of the suitcase.\n- Check if one square fits along the length and the other fits along the width.\n- Ensure that rotating the squares doesn't affect the result since they're squares.\n\n## Example Problems:\n### Problem 1: [Check Rectangle Fit](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/rectangle-fit/problem)\n**Problem Description**: Given two integers representing the sides of a rectangle, check if the rectangle can fit inside another given rectangle.\n\n**Solution**: This involves checking if the smaller rectangle can fit along either dimension of the larger rectangle.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef can_fit(small_a, small_b, large_m, large_n):\n    return (small_a <= large_m and small_b <= large_n) or (small_a <= large_n and small_b <= large_m)\n\nprint(can_fit(int(input()), int(input()), int(input()), int(input())))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: [Square Packing](https://leetcode.com/problems/squares-in-a-square/)\n**Problem Description**: Given a side length for a square and a target area, find the smallest square that can contain the given number of unit squares.\n\n**Solution**: This involves understanding how squares can be packed optimally within a larger square.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef min_square(n):\n    k = int(math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)))\n    while n > k * k:\n        k += 1\n    return k\n\nprint(min_square(int(input())))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: [Rectangle Packing](https://codeforces.com/problemset/problem/405/A)\n**Problem Description**: Given several rectangles, determine if they can fit into a single larger rectangle.\n\n**Solution**: This involves a more complex algorithm considering multiple rectangles and their placement.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef can_pack_rectangles(rectangles, m, n):\n    # Simplified example logic\n    total_area = sum([w * h for w, h in rectangles])\n    if total_area > m * n:\n        return \"NO\"\n    return \"YES\"\n\nrectangles = []\nfor _ in range(int(input())):\n    w, h = map(int, input().split())\n    rectangles.append((w, h))\nm, n = map(int, input().split())\n\nprint(can_pack_rectangles(rectangles, m, n))\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n### Explanation of the Solution:\nThe problem requires us to determine if two squares can fit inside a rectangle. Since the squares can rotate, we need to consider all possible orientations (two squares fitting along the length and width of the rectangle, or vice versa). The solution checks if the squares can fit along both dimensions of the rectangle.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef fit_in(a, b, m, n):\n    # Check all possible orientations\n    return (a <= m and b <= n) or (a <= n and b <= m) or \\\n           (a <= m and a + b <= n) or (a + b <= m and a <= n) or \\\n           (b <= m and b + a <= n) or (b + a <= m and b <= n)\n\n# Read input\na = int(input())\nb = int(input())\nm = int(input())\nn = int(input())\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(fit_in(a, b, m, n))\n```\n\nThis solution ensures that we check all possible placements of the squares within the rectangle, including rotations, and returns whether they can fit or not."], "prompt_tokens": [408], "completion_tokens": [937], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 3155}

One straightforward approach is to use a brute-force algorithm that checks every possible pair of elements in the sequence and counts those that are out of order. However, this approach has a time complexity of O(n^2), which may not be efficient for large sequences.\n\nA more efficient approach is to use a modified merge sort algorithm, known as the \"Counting Inversions\" algorithm. This algorithm sorts the array while simultaneously counting inversions. The merge sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n), making it suitable for large sequences.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Counting Inversions Algorithm\nThe Counting Inversions algorithm uses a divide-and-conquer strategy similar to merge sort. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n\n1. **Divide**: Split the array into two halves.\n2. **Conquer**: Recursively count inversions in both halves.\n3. **Combine**: Merge the two halves and count split inversions during the merge process.\n\n### Merging Process with Inversion Count\nDuring the merging step, we compare elements from the left and right halves. When an element from the right half is smaller than an element from the left half, it means there are inversions. Specifically, if `left[i] > right[j]`, all remaining elements in the left half (`left[i+1]` to `left[n-1]`) form inversions with `right[j]`.\n\nHere's how the merge step works:\n\n1. Initialize counters for indices and inversion count.\n2. Compare elements from both halves.\n3. Copy smaller elements to the temporary array and increment the corresponding index counter.\n4. If an inversion is found, add the remaining elements from the left half to the inversion count.\n5. Copy any remaining elements from either half.\n\n## Example Problems:\n### Problem 1: Number of Inversions in an Array\n**Problem Statement**: Given an array of size N, find the total number of inversions in the array.

Specifically, we need to calculate the number of integers between 1 and \\( n \\) that contain exactly \\( k \\) non-zero digits. This can be approached using dynamic programming where we keep track of the number of valid numbers up to a certain point, considering whether each digit is included or excluded.\n\n### Dynamic Programming Approach:\nWe'll use a DP table where:\n- `dp[i][j][z]` represents the number of ways to form a number with at most `i` digits such that it has exactly `j` non-zero digits, and `z` indicates whether the current prefix is strictly less than the corresponding prefix of `n`.\n\nThe transitions will involve iterating over each digit and updating our DP states accordingly.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\nDynamic Programming (DP) is a powerful algorithmic technique used to solve complex problems by breaking them down into simpler subproblems. The key idea behind DP is to store the results of these subproblems so that they can be reused when needed again, thus avoiding redundant calculations.\n\nIn this problem, we apply DP to count numbers with exactly \\( k \\) non-zero digits within a given range. Here's how the transition works:\n- We iterate over each position in the number.\n- For each position, we consider all possible digits (0 through 9).\n- We update our DP state based on whether including the current digit increases the count of non-zero digits and whether the current prefix is still less than or equal to the corresponding prefix of `n`.\n\nThe base case is straightforward: if we have no digits left to place (`i == 0`), then we have one way to form a number if there are no non-zero digits required (`j == 0`).\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n1. **Counting Numbers with Exactly `k` Non-Zero Digits**\n   - **Problem**: Count the numbers between 1 and \\( n \\) that have exactly \\( k \\) non-zero digits.\n   - **Solution**: Use the same DP approach as described above.\n   \n2. **Permutations with Restrictions**\n   - **Problem**: Calculate the number of permutations of length \\( n \\) where each element appears at most once and there are exactly \\( k \\) elements greater than their index.\n   - **Solution**: Use combinatorics and dynamic programming to keep track of counts based on the current index and number of elements exceeding their index.\n   \n3. **Digit Sum Modulo**\n   - **Problem**: Find the count of numbers between 1 and \\( n \\) whose sum of digits modulo \\( m \\) equals \\( x \\).\n   - **Solution**: Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a number with at most `i` digits having a digit sum modulo \\( m \\) equal to \\( j \\).\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n```python\ndef almost_everywhere_zero(n, k):\n    # Convert n to string to easily access individual digits\n    s = str(n)\n    L = len(s)\n    \n    # Initialize DP table\n    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(L + 1)] for _ in range(2)]\n    \n    # Base case initialization\n    dp[0][0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, L + 1):\n        for j in range(i + 1):\n            for z in range(2):\n                for d in range(10):\n                    new_z = z\n                    if d != 0:\n                        new_j = min(j + 1, k)\n                    else:\n                        new_j = j\n                    \n                    if z == 1:\n                        dp[z][new_j][d] += dp[0][new_j][d]\n                    elif int(s[:i]) >= d * 10**(L-i):\n                        dp[z][new_j][d] += dp[0][new_j][d]\n        \n        # Move to next state\n        dp[0], dp[1] = dp[1], dp[0]\n    \n    result = sum(dp[0][j][0] for j in range(k + 1))\n    return result\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    n = int(input())\n    k = int(input())\n    print(almost_everywhere_zero(n, k))\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n- **Initialization**: We initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j][z]` keeps track of the number of ways to form a number with at most `i` digits, having exactly `j` non-zero digits, and being less than or equal to the corresponding prefix of `n`.\n- **Base Case**: `dp[0][0][0] = 1` because there is one way to form an empty number with 0 non-zero digits.\n- **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate over each digit position and each possible digit value (0 through 9).

{"name": "1627", "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "1232\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "123220\n6", "output": [true]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef is_polydivisible(n, b):\n    chars = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    polydivisible = True\n    number = \"\"\n    \n    for i in range(len(n)):\n        number += n[i]\n        num_base_b = sum(int(number[j]) * (len(chars) ** (i - j)) for j in range(i + 1))\n        if num_base_b % (i + 1) != 0:\n            polydivisible = False\n            break\n    \n    return polydivisible\n\ndef get_polydivisible(n, b):\n    chars = \"0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz\"\n    count = 0\n    current_number = \"\"\n    \n    while True:\n        if is_polydivisible(current_number, b):\n            count += 1\n            if count == n:\n                return current_number\n        current_number += chars[(len(current_number) + 1) % len(chars)]\n\n# Main code to take input and output the result\nn, b = map(int, input().split())\nprint(is_polydivisible(str(n), b))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["## Algorithms:\nThe core concept used to solve this problem is number manipulation and divisibility checks.

Common operations include addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulus, and conversion between different numerical representations such as decimal, binary, octal, and hexadecimal.\n\n### Divisibility Checks:\nDivisibility checks determine whether one number is evenly divisible by another without leaving a remainder. This can be achieved using the modulus operator (%).

It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

This approach helps in understanding the distribution of divisors and simplifies the calculation.\n\n### Tutorial:\n#### Divisor Function:\nThe divisor function \\( d(n) \\) for a number \\( n \\) can be calculated by iterating through all numbers from 1 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\). If \\( i \\) divides \\( n \\), then both \\( i \\) and \\( n/i \\) are divisors of \\( n \\). However, if \\( n \\) is a perfect square, \\( i \\) would be counted twice, so we adjust accordingly.\n\n#### Sum of Divisors:\nUsing the divisor function, we can compute \\( S(n) \\) by summing \\( d(i) \\) for all \\( i \\) from 1 to \\( n \\). However, this approach is inefficient for large \\( n \\). Instead, we use the properties of the divisor function and pairing method mentioned.\n\n#### Efficient Pair Counting:\nThe number of pairs \\((m, n)\\) such that \\( m \\times n \\leq k \\) can be understood by considering the range of \\( m \\) for each \\( n \\). Specifically, for each \\( n \\), \\( m \\) ranges from 1 to \\( \\lfloor k/n \\rfloor \\). By summing over all \\( n \\), we get the total number of such pairs.\n\n### Example Problems:\n#### Problem 1: Count Divisors of a Number\n**Problem Statement**: Given a number \\( n \\), count its divisors.\n**Solution**: Iterate from 1 to \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) and count divisors.\n```python\ndef count_divisors(n):\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if i * i == n:\n                count += 1\n            else:\n                count += 2\n    return count\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Sum of First N Natural Numbers\n**Problem Statement**: Calculate the sum of the first \\( n \\) natural numbers.\n**Solution**: Use the formula \\( S(n) = n \\times (n+1) / 2 \\).\n```python\ndef sum_of_natural_numbers(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) // 2\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Total Number of Divisors Up to N\n**Problem Statement**: Find the total number of divisors of all numbers up to \\( n \\).\n**Solution**: Use the divisor function for each number up to \\( n \\).\n```python\ndef total_divisors_up_to_n(n):\n    total_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_divisors += count_divisors(i)\n    return total_divisors\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n**Explanation**: The core idea is to use the pairing method to count the number of pairs \\((m, n)\\) such that \\( m \\times n \\leq n \\). This approach significantly reduces the computational complexity compared to brute-force methods.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_of_divisors(n):\n    total_divisors = 0\n    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            if i * i == n:\n                total_divisors += 1\n            else:\n                total_divisors += 2\n    return total_divisors\n\ndef sum_of_squares(n):\n    return n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1) // 6\n\ndef sum_of_divisors_function(n):\n    result = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result += sum_of_divisors(i)\n    return result\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input().strip())\n\n# Compute and print the result\nprint(sum_of_divisors_function(n))\n```\nThis code defines the necessary helper functions and computes the sum of divisors for all numbers up to \\( n \\).

Thank you problem writers.\n\nYou are helping an archaeologist decipher some runes. He knows that this ancient society used a Base 10 system, and that they never start a number with a leading zero. He's figured out most of the digits as well as a few operators, but he needs your help to figure out the rest.\n\nThe professor will give you a simple math expression, of the form\n\n```\n[number][op][number]=[number]\n```\n\nHe has converted all of the runes he knows into digits. The only operators he knows are addition (`+`),subtraction(`-`), and multiplication (`*`), so those are the only ones that will appear. Each number will be in the range from -1000000 to 1000000, and will consist of only the digits 0-9, possibly a leading -, and maybe a few ?s. If there are ?s in an expression, they represent a digit rune that the professor doesn't know (never an operator, and never a leading -). All of the ?s in an expression will represent the same digit (0-9), and it won't be one of the other given digits in the expression. No number will begin with a 0 unless the number itself is  0, therefore 00 would not be a valid number. \n\nGiven an expression, figure out the value of the rune represented by the question mark.

When encountering a closing bracket, check if it matches the last opened bracket.\n```python\ndef isValid(s):\n    stack = []\n    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    for char in s:\n        if char in mapping.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in mapping:\n            if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():\n                return False\n        else:\n            return False\n    return not stack\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Roman to Integer\n**Problem Description**: Convert a Roman numeral to an integer.\n**Solution**: Maintain a dictionary for Roman numerals and iterate through the string, converting symbols based on their values.\n```python\ndef romanToInt(s):\n    roman_dict = {'I': 1, 'V': 5, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'C': 100, 'D': 500, 'M': 1000}\n    num = 0\n    prev_value = 0\n    for symbol in reversed(s):\n        value = roman_dict[symbol]\n        if value < prev_value:\n            num -= value\n        else:\n            num += value\n        prev_value = value\n    return num\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Two Sum\n**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.\n**Solution**: Use a hash map to store numbers and their indices as we iterate through the array.\n```python\ndef twoSum(nums, target):\n    seen = {}\n    for i, num in enumerate(nums):\n        complement = target - num\n        if complement in seen:\n            return [seen[complement], i]\n        seen[num] = i\n    return []\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n1. **Extract Components**: Split the input string to extract the two numbers, the operator, and the result.\n2. **Brute Force Try Each Digit**: Iterate over digits 0 to 9, replacing '?' with the current digit and evaluating the equation.\n3. **Check Validity**: Ensure the equation holds true and return the smallest valid digit or -1 if none exist.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef solve_rune_expression(expression):\n    # Split the expression into components\n    parts = expression.split('=')\n    left_parts = parts[0].split('+')\n    lhs, rhs = None, None\n    \n    # Identify the component containing '?'\n    if left_parts[0].find('?') != -1:\n        lhs, rhs = left_parts[0], parts[1]\n    elif left_parts[1].find('?') != -1:\n        lhs, rhs = left_parts[1], parts[1]\n    \n    # Try replacing '?' with each digit 0-9\n    for d in range(10):\n        new_lhs = str(lhs).replace('?', str(d))\n        new_rhs = str(rhs).replace('?', str(d))\n        \n        # Evaluate the expression\n        if eval(new_lhs + '+' + new_rhs) == int(new_rhs):\n            return d\n    \n    # Return -1 if no valid digit found\n    return -1\n\n# Example usage\nexpression = input()\nprint(solve_rune_expression(expression))\n```\n\nThis code snippet defines the function `solve_rune_expression` which takes an expression as input, processes it, and outputs the smallest valid digit for '?' or -1 if no valid digit exists.

This can be done using a dictionary where keys are words and values are integers.\n\n```python\nword_to_num = {\n    'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,\n    'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9,\n    'ten': 10, 'eleven': 11, 'twelve': 12, 'thirteen': 13,\n    'fourteen': 14, 'fifteen': 15, 'sixteen': 16, 'seventeen': 17,\n    'eighteen': 18, 'nineteen': 19, 'twenty': 20, 'thirty': 30,\n    'forty': 40, 'fifty': 50, 'sixty': 60, 'seventy': 70, 'eighty': 80,\n    'ninety': 90, 'hundred': 100, 'thousand': 1000, 'million': 1000000\n}\n```\n\n#### Handling Tens and Hundreds\nFor words representing tens and hundreds, we need to ensure that they correctly scale the subsequent digits. For example, \"twenty-one\" should be parsed as 21, not just 20.\n\n```python\ndef parse_number(s):\n    total = current = 0\n    word_list = s.split()\n\n    for word in word_list:\n        if word == 'and':\n            continue\n        num = word_to_num[word]\n        \n        if num < 100:\n            current += num\n        elif num == 100:\n            current *= num\n        else:\n            total += current * num\n            current = 0\n    \n    return total + current\n```\n\n### Example Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: Convert Words to Number (LeetCode #273)\n**Problem Description:** Given an integer, convert it to a roman numeral. Input is guaranteed to be within the range from 1 to 3999.\n\n**Solution:**\nThis problem involves similar parsing techniques but focuses on converting numbers to Roman numerals instead of words to integers.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def intToRoman(self, num):\n        val = [1000, 900, 500, 400,\n               100, 90, 50, 40,\n               10, 9, 5, 4,\n               1]\n        syms = [\"M\", \"CM\", \"D\", \"CD\",\n                \"C\", \"XC\", \"L\", \"XL\",\n                \"X\", \"IX\", \"V\", \"IV\",\n                \"I\"]\n        roman_numeral = ''\n        i = 0\n        while num > 0:\n            for _ in range(num // val[i]):\n                roman_numeral += syms[i]\n                num -= val[i]\n            i += 1\n        return roman_numeral\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: String to Integer (atoi) (LeetCode #8)\n**Problem Description:** Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.\n\n**Solution:**\nThis problem requires understanding how to handle leading spaces, signs, and invalid characters, making it more complex than the original problem but involving similar parsing techniques.\n\n```python\nclass Solution:\n    def myAtoi(self, str):\n        INT_MAX = 2147483647\n        INT_MIN = -2147483648\n        result = 0\n        sign = 1\n        i = 0\n        \n        while i < len(str) and str[i] == ' ':\n            i += 1\n        \n        if i < len(str) and (str[i] == '+' or str[i] == '-'):\n            sign = 1 if str[i] == '+' else -1\n            i += 1\n        \n        while i < len(str) and str[i].isdigit():\n            digit = ord(str[i]) - ord('0')\n            if result > INT_MAX // 10 or (result == INT_MAX // 10 and digit > 7):\n                return INT_MAX if sign == 1 else INT_MIN\n            result = result * 10 + digit\n            i += 1\n        \n        return sign * result\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Largest Number (LeetCode #179)\n**Problem Description:** Given a list of non-negative integers, arrange them such that they form the largest number.\n\n**Solution:**\nThis problem involves sorting based on custom rules, which can be achieved using a priority queue or a custom sort function.\n\n```python\nfrom functools import cmp_to_key\n\ndef largestNumber(nums):\n    nums = [str(x) for x in nums]\n    nums.sort(key=cmp_to_key(lambda x, y: int(y+x) - int(x+y)))\n    result = ''.join(nums).lstrip('0')\n    return result if result else '0'\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n**Explanation of the Solution:**\n\nThe provided code uses a dictionary to map words to numbers and a simple algorithm to parse through the input string, accumulating the final numeric value.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n\n```python\nword_to_num = {\n    'zero': 0, 'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3, 'four': 4,\n    'five': 5, 'six': 6, 'seven': 7, 'eight': 8, 'nine': 9,\n    'ten': 10, 'eleven': 11, 'twelve': 12, 'thirteen': 13,\n    'fourteen': 14, 'fifteen': 15, 'sixteen': 16, 'seventeen': 17,\n    'eighteen': 18, 'nineteen': 19, 'twenty': 20, 'thirty': 30,\n    'forty': 40, 'fifty': 50, 'sixty': 60, 'seventy': 70, 'eighty': 80,\n    'ninety': 90, 'hundred': 100, 'thousand': 1000, 'million': 1000000\n}\n\ndef parse_number(s):\n    total = current = 0\n    word_list = s.split()\n\n    for word in word_list:\n        if word == 'and':\n            continue\n        num = word_to_num[word]\n        \n        if num < 100:\n            current += num\n        elif num == 100:\n            current *= num\n        else:\n            total += current * num\n            current = 0\n    \n    return total + current\n\n# Main function to read input and print output\ndef main():\n    s = input().strip()\n    result = parse_number(s)\n    print(result)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nThis code reads a string from standard input, processes it according to the described algorithm, and prints the resulting integer."], "prompt_tokens": [402], "completion_tokens": [1781], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1616}
