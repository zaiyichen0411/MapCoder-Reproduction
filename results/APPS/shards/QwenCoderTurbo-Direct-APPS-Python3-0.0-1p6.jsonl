{"name": "1663", "description": "In this Kata we focus on finding a sum S(n) which is the total number of divisors taken for all natural numbers less or equal to n. More formally, we investigate the sum of n components denoted by d(1) + d(2) + ... + d(n) in which for any i starting from 1 up to n the value of d(i) tells us how many distinct numbers divide i without a remainder. \n\nYour solution should work for possibly large values of n without a timeout.\nAssume n to be greater than zero and not greater than 999 999 999 999 999.\nBrute force approaches will not be feasible options in such cases. It is fairly simple to conclude that for every n>1 there holds a recurrence S(n) = S(n-1) + d(n) with initial case S(1) = 1.\n\nFor example:\nS(1) = 1\nS(2) = 3\nS(3) = 5\nS(4) = 8\nS(5) = 10\n\nBut is the fact useful anyway? If you find it is rather not, maybe this will help: \n\nTry to convince yourself that for any natural k, the number S(k) is the same as the number of pairs (m,n) that solve the inequality mn <= k in natural numbers.\nOnce it becomes clear, we can think of a partition of all the solutions into classes just by saying that a pair (m,n) belongs to the class indexed by n.\nThe question now arises if it is possible to count solutions of n-th class. If f(n) stands for the number of solutions that belong to n-th class, it means that S(k) = f(1) + f(2) + f(3) + ...\n\nThe reasoning presented above leads us to some kind of a formula for S(k), however not necessarily the most efficient one.

{"name": "2064", "description": "3R2 as DJ Mashiro - Happiness Breeze Ice - DJ Mashiro is dead or alive\n\nNEKO#\u03a6\u03c9\u03a6 has just got a new maze game on her PC!\n\nThe game's main puzzle is a maze, in the forms of a $2 \\times n$ rectangle grid. NEKO's task is to lead a Nekomimi girl from cell $(1, 1)$ to the gate at $(2, n)$ and escape the maze. The girl can only move between cells sharing a common side.\n\nHowever, at some moments during the game, some cells may change their state: either from normal ground to lava (which forbids movement into that cell), or vice versa (which makes that cell passable again). Initially all cells are of the ground type.\n\nAfter hours of streaming, NEKO finally figured out there are only $q$ such moments: the $i$-th moment toggles the state of cell $(r_i, c_i)$ (either from ground to lava or vice versa).\n\nKnowing this, NEKO wonders, after each of the $q$ moments, whether it is still possible to move from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$ without going through any lava cells.\n\nAlthough NEKO is a great streamer and gamer, she still can't get through quizzes and problems requiring large amount of Brain Power. Can you help her?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers $n$, $q$ ($2 \\le n \\le 10^5$, $1 \\le q \\le 10^5$).\n\nThe $i$-th of $q$ following lines contains two integers $r_i$, $c_i$ ($1 \\le r_i \\le 2$, $1 \\le c_i \\le n$), denoting the coordinates of the cell to be flipped at the $i$-th moment.\n\nIt is guaranteed that cells $(1, 1)$ and $(2, n)$ never appear in the query list.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each moment, if it is possible to travel from cell $(1, 1)$ to cell $(2, n)$, print \"Yes\", otherwise print \"No\". There should be exactly $q$ answers, one after every update.\n\nYou can print the words in any case (either lowercase, uppercase or mixed).\n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n\nOutput\nYes\nNo\nNo\nNo\nYes\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nWe'll crack down the example test here:  After the first query, the girl still able to reach the goal. One of the shortest path ways should be: $(1,1) \\to (1,2) \\to (1,3) \\to (1,4) \\to (1,5) \\to (2,5)$.  After the second query, it's impossible to move to the goal, since the farthest cell she could reach is $(1, 3)$.  After the fourth query, the $(2, 3)$ is not blocked, but now all the $4$-th column is blocked, so she still can't reach the goal.  After the fifth query, the column barrier has been lifted, thus she can go to the final goal again.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2064, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5\n2 3\n1 4\n2 4\n2 3\n1 4\n",
