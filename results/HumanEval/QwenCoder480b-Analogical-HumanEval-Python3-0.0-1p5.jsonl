The key steps are:\n1. **Parse the input**: Split the string into words while preserving spaces\n2. **Process each component**: For each word, sort its characters by ASCII value\n3. **Reconstruct the output**: Maintain the original word order and spacing\n\nIn Python, we can use `split()` to break strings into words, but this removes spaces. To preserve spaces, we need to either:\n- Use regular expressions to split while keeping delimiters\n- Process character by character\n- Or reconstruct spaces manually\n\nA more elegant approach is to split by spaces, process each word, then rejoin with spaces.\n\nFor sorting characters, Python's built-in `sorted()` function works perfectly as it sorts by ASCII values by default.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Sort Characters By Frequency\n**Description**: Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.\n**Solution**: Count character frequencies using a dictionary or Counter, then sort characters by their frequencies in descending order. Characters with the same frequency can be in any order.\n**Code**:\n```python\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef frequencySort(s):\n    counter = Counter(s)\n    # Sort by frequency (descending) then by character (ascending for tie-breaking)\n    sorted_chars = sorted(counter.items(), key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))\n    result = []\n    for char, freq in sorted_chars:\n        result.append(char * freq)\n    return ''.join(result)\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Group Anagrams\n**Description**: Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.\n**Solution**: For each string, create a canonical form by sorting its characters. Use this canonical form as a key in a dictionary to group anagrams.\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef groupAnagrams(strs):\n    anagram_groups = {}\n    for s in strs:\n        # Create canonical form by sorting characters\n        key = ''.join(sorted(s))\n        if key not in anagram_groups:\n            anagram_groups[key] = []\n        anagram_groups[key].append(s)\n    return list(anagram_groups.values())\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Reverse Words in a String\n**Description**: Given a string, reverse the order of words while handling multiple spaces correctly.\n**Solution**: Split the string into words (handling multiple spaces), reverse the list of words, then join them back with single spaces.\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef reverseWords(s):\n    # Split by whitespace and filter out empty strings\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse the list of words\n    reversed_words = words[::-1]\n    # Join with single space\n    return ' '.join(reversed_words)\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1.

Join the sorted characters back into a word\n4. Join all processed words back together with spaces to maintain the original sentence structure\n\nThis approach handles multiple spaces correctly because `split()` without arguments treats consecutive whitespace as a single separator, and `' '.join()` puts exactly one space between words.\n\n```python\ndef anti_shuffle(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function that takes a string and returns an ordered version of it.\n    Ordered version of string, is a string where all words (separated by space)\n    are replaced by a new word where all the characters arranged in\n    ascending order based on ascii value.\n    Note: You should keep the order of words and blank spaces in the sentence.\n\n    For example:\n    anti_shuffle('Hi') returns 'Hi'\n    anti_shuffle('hello') returns 'ehllo'\n    anti_shuffle('Hello World!!!') returns 'Hello !!!Wdlor'\n    \"\"\"\n    # Split the string into words\n    words = s.split()\n    \n    # Process each word by sorting its characters\n    ordered_words = []\n    for word in words:\n        # Sort characters in ascending order by ASCII value\n        ordered_word = ''.join(sorted(word))\n        ordered_words.append(ordered_word)\n    \n    # Join the ordered words back with spaces\n    return ' '.join(ordered_words)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [295], "completion_tokens": [973], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

This eliminates rows/columns efficiently.\n\n```python\ndef searchMatrix(matrix, target):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return False\n    \n    row, col = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    \n    while row < len(matrix) and col >= 0:\n        if matrix[row][col] == target:\n            return True\n        elif matrix[row][col] > target:\n            col -= 1\n        else:\n            row += 1\n    \n    return False\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Spiral Matrix\n**Description**: Given an m x n matrix, return all elements of the matrix in spiral order.\n\n**Solution**: Use four boundaries (top, bottom, left, right) and traverse layer by layer in four directions: left\u2192right, top\u2192bottom, right\u2192left, bottom\u2192top.\n\n```python\ndef spiralOrder(matrix):\n    if not matrix:\n        return []\n    \n    result = []\n    top, bottom = 0, len(matrix) - 1\n    left, right = 0, len(matrix[0]) - 1\n    \n    while top <= bottom and left <= right:\n        # Left to right\n        for col in range(left, right + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[top][col])\n        top += 1\n        \n        # Top to bottom\n        for row in range(top, bottom + 1):\n            result.append(matrix[row][right])\n        right -= 1\n        \n        # Right to left (check if row still valid)\n        if top <= bottom:\n            for col in range(right, left - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[bottom][col])\n            bottom -= 1\n        \n        # Bottom to top (check if col still valid)\n        if left <= right:\n            for row in range(bottom, top - 1, -1):\n                result.append(matrix[row][left])\n            left += 1\n    \n    return result\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Set Matrix Zeroes\n**Description**: Given an m x n integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's. Solve it in-place.\n\n**Solution**: Use the first row and first column as markers to indicate which rows/columns should be zeroed. Handle the first row and column separately to avoid conflicts.\n\n```python\ndef setZeroes(matrix):\n    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:\n        return\n    \n    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])\n    first_row_zero = any(matrix[0][j] == 0 for j in range(cols))\n    first_col_zero = any(matrix[i][0] == 0 for i in range(rows))\n    \n    # Mark zeros on first row and column\n    for i in range(1, rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            if matrix[i][j] == 0:\n                matrix[i][0] = 0\n                matrix[0][j] = 0\n    \n    # Zero out cells based on marks\n    for i in range(1, rows):\n        for j in range(1, cols):\n            if matrix[i][0] == 0 or matrix[0][j] == 0:\n                matrix[i][j] = 0\n    \n    # Zero out first row if needed\n    if first_row_zero:\n        for j in range(cols):\n            matrix[0][j] = 0\n    \n    # Zero out first column if needed\n    if first_col_zero:\n        for i in range(rows):\n            matrix[i][0] = 0\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. **Handle edge case**: If the input list is empty, return an empty list immediately\n2. **Traverse the 2D list**: Use nested loops or enumeration to go through each row and column\n3. **Find matches**: When we encounter the target value `x`, record its coordinates as a tuple (row_index, column_index)\n4. **Sort results**: Sort by row ascending first, then by column descending within the same row. We can do this by using a custom key function that returns (row, -column) so that columns sort in descending order\n5. **Return the sorted coordinates**\n\n```python\ndef get_row(lst, x):\n    \"\"\"\n    Find all occurrences of x in a 2D list and return their coordinates.\n    Coordinates are sorted by row ascending, then by column descending.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Handle empty input\n    if not lst:\n        return []\n    \n    coordinates = []\n    \n    # Traverse each row with its index\n    for row_idx, row in enumerate(lst):\n        # Traverse each element in the row with its column index\n        for col_idx, element in enumerate(row):\n            if element == x:\n                coordinates.append((row_idx, col_idx))\n    \n    # Sort by row ascending, then by column descending\n    # Using (row, -col) as key makes column sort in descending order\n    coordinates.sort(key=lambda coord: (coord[0], -coord[1]))\n    \n    return coordinates\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [424], "completion_tokens": [1451], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

Here's a systematic approach:\n\n1. **Identify Delimiters**: First, determine what separates the units you're interested in (sentences, words, etc.)\n\n2. **Split Operations**: Use `split()` or `partition()` methods to break strings, or use regular expressions for complex patterns.\n\n3. **Boundary Conditions**: Handle edge cases like empty strings, multiple consecutive delimiters, or leading/trailing spaces.\n\n4. **Pattern Matching**: Once you have individual components, check them against your criteria using `startswith()`, `endswith()`, or substring operations.\n\n5. **Accumulation**: Count or collect results as you process each component.\n\nFor this problem specifically:\n- Split by sentence delimiters (`.`, `?`, `!`)\n- For each sentence, extract the first word\n- Check if the first word is exactly \"I\"\n- Count matches\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Word Frequency Counter\n**Description**: Given a text document, count how many times each word appears.\n\n**Solution**: \n1. Convert text to lowercase for case-insensitive counting\n2. Remove punctuation and split into words\n3. Use a dictionary to track word frequencies\n4. Iterate through words and increment counts\n\n```python\ndef word_frequency(text):\n    # Remove punctuation and convert to lowercase\n    cleaned = ''.join(c.lower() if c.isalnum() or c.isspace() else ' ' for c in text)\n    words = cleaned.split()\n    \n    freq = {}\n    for word in words:\n        freq[word] = freq.get(word, 0) + 1\n    \n    return freq\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Valid Parentheses\n**Description**: Determine if a string containing just parentheses characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[', ']' is valid.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Use a stack data structure\n2. Push opening brackets onto stack\n3. When encountering closing brackets, check if they match the most recent opening bracket\n4. String is valid if all brackets are matched and stack is empty\n\n```python\ndef isValid(s):\n    stack = []\n    mapping = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    \n    for char in s:\n        if char in mapping.values():\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char in mapping.keys():\n            if not stack or stack.pop() != mapping[char]:\n                return False\n        else:\n            return False\n    \n    return len(stack) == 0\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Longest Palindromic Substring\n**Description**: Find the longest palindromic substring in a given string.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Expand around centers approach\n2. For each possible center (both single character and between characters), expand outward\n3. Keep track of the longest palindrome found\n4. Handle both odd and even length palindromes\n\n```python\ndef longestPalindrome(s):\n    if not s:\n        return \"\"\n    \n    start = 0\n    max_len = 1\n    \n    def expand_around_center(left, right):\n        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:\n            left -= 1\n            right += 1\n        return right - left - 1\n    \n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        len1 = expand_around_center(i, i)      # Odd length\n        len2 = expand_around_center(i, i + 1)  # Even length\n        current_max = max(len1, len2)\n        \n        if current_max > max_len:\n            max_len = current_max\n            start = i - (current_max - 1) // 2\n    \n    return s[start:start + max_len]\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. Split the input string by sentence delimiters ('.', '?', '!') to get individual sentences\n2. For each sentence:\n   - Strip leading/trailing whitespace\n   - Skip empty sentences\n   - Split into words and check if the first word is exactly \"I\"\n3. Count all sentences that satisfy the condition\n\nThe key insight is handling edge cases:\n- Multiple spaces between sentences\n- Empty sentences after splitting\n- Making sure we match exactly \"I\" and not words that start with \"I\"\n\n```python\ndef is_bored(S):\n    \"\"\"\n    You'll be given a string of words, and your task is to count the number\n    of boredoms.

The first few prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, etc.\n\n### Sieve of Eratosthenes\nThis is an ancient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit. It works by iteratively marking the multiples of each prime, starting from 2.\n\n**Algorithm Steps:**\n1. Create a list of consecutive integers from 2 through n: (2, 3, 4, ..., n)\n2. Mark all multiples of 2 (except 2 itself) as composite\n3. Find the next number in the list that is not marked - this is the next prime\n4. Mark all multiples of this prime as composite\n5. Repeat steps 3-4 until we've processed numbers up to \u221an\n6. All unmarked numbers are prime\n\n**Time Complexity:** O(n log log n)\n**Space Complexity:** O(n)\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Count Primes\n**Description:** Count the number of prime numbers less than a non-negative number n.\n\n**Solution:** Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to mark all composite numbers, then count the unmarked ones.\n\n```python\ndef countPrimes(n):\n    if n <= 2:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Initialize boolean array - True means potentially prime\n    is_prime = [True] * n\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime\n    \n    # Sieve process\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            # Mark all multiples of i as composite\n            for j in range(i*i, n, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    # Count primes\n    return sum(is_prime)\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Prime Arrangements\n**Description:** Return the number of permutations of 1 to n such that prime numbers are at prime indices (1-indexed).\n\n**Solution:** First find all primes up to n using sieve, then calculate permutations of primes at prime positions and non-primes at non-prime positions.\n\n```python\ndef numPrimeArrangements(n):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    \n    # Sieve to find primes\n    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n    \n    for i in range(2, int((n + 1)**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i*i, n + 1, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    # Count primes and non-primes\n    prime_count = sum(is_prime[1:n+1])\n    non_prime_count = n - prime_count\n    \n    # Calculate factorials\n    def factorial(x):\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, x + 1):\n            result = (result * i) % MOD\n        return result\n    \n    return (factorial(prime_count) * factorial(non_prime_count)) % MOD\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Ugly Number II\n**Description:** Find the n-th ugly number where an ugly number is a positive number whose prime factors only include 2, 3, 5.\n\n**Solution:** This uses a different approach with pointers to generate numbers in ascending order, but still involves prime factorization concepts.\n\n```python\ndef nthUglyNumber(n):\n    ugly = [1]\n    i2 = i3 = i5 = 0\n    \n    while len(ugly) < n:\n        next_ugly = min(ugly[i2]*2, ugly[i3]*3, ugly[i5]*5)\n        ugly.append(next_ugly)\n        \n        if next_ugly == ugly[i2]*2:\n            i2 += 1\n        if next_ugly == ugly[i3]*3:\n            i3 += 1\n        if next_ugly == ugly[i5]*5:\n            i5 += 1\n            \n    return ugly[n-1]\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1.

Indices start from 0 and go up to length-1. We can iterate through a string using loops and access specific characters using bracket notation `string[index]`.\n\n### Conditional Logic\nWe use conditional statements (`if`) to check multiple conditions:\n- Whether an index is even: `index % 2 == 0`\n- Whether a character is an uppercase vowel: `char in 'AEIOU'`\n\n### Counting Technique\nWe maintain a counter variable that we increment each time we find an element meeting our criteria.\n\n### Even Index Check\nAn index is even if it's divisible by 2 (remainder is 0 when divided by 2). We use the modulo operator `%` to check this: `index % 2 == 0`.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Count Lowercase Consonants at Odd Indices\n**Description**: Given a string, count the number of lowercase consonants at odd indices.\n\n**Solution**: \n1. Iterate through the string with indices\n2. Check if index is odd (index % 2 == 1)\n3. Check if character is lowercase (char.islower())\n4. Check if character is not a vowel (char not in 'aeiou')\n5. Count characters meeting all conditions\n\n```python\ndef count_lower_consonants_odd(s):\n    vowels = 'aeiou'\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i].islower() and s[i].isalpha() and s[i] not in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Alternating Character Sum\n**Description**: Given a string of digits, calculate the sum where digits at even indices are added and digits at odd indices are subtracted.\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Iterate through string with indices\n2. Convert each character to integer\n3. If index is even, add to sum; if odd, subtract from sum\n\n```python\ndef alternating_sum(s):\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        digit = int(s[i])\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += digit\n        else:\n            total -= digit\n    return total\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Vowel Pair Counter\n**Description**: Count pairs of consecutive characters where both are vowels (uppercase or lowercase).\n\n**Solution**:\n1. Iterate through string up to second-to-last character\n2. Check if current character and next character are both vowels\n3. Count such pairs\n\n```python\ndef count_vowel_pairs(s):\n    vowels = 'aeiouAEIOU'\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(s) - 1):\n        if s[i] in vowels and s[i + 1] in vowels:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. Define the set of uppercase vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'\n2. Initialize a counter to zero\n3. Iterate through the string using indices (using `range(len(s))`)\n4. For each character, check two conditions:\n   - The index is even (index % 2 == 0)\n   - The character is an uppercase vowel (character in 'AEIOU')\n5. If both conditions are met, increment the counter\n6. Return the final count\n\nLet's trace through the examples:\n- `'aBCdEf'`: Index 0='a'(not uppercase), 2='C'(not vowel), 4='E'(uppercase vowel) \u2192 count = 1\n- `'abcdefg'`: No uppercase vowels \u2192 count = 0  \n- `'dBBE'`: Index 0='d'(not vowel), 2='B'(not vowel) \u2192 count = 0\n\n```python\ndef count_upper(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.\n    \n    For example:\n    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1\n    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0\n    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0\n    \"\"\"\n    uppercase_vowels = 'AEIOU'\n    count = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through the string with indices\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # Check if index is even and character is an uppercase vowel\n        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] in uppercase_vowels:\n            count += 1\n    \n    return count\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [237], "completion_tokens": [1079], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

Apply the rounding rules:\n   - If fractional part < 0.5: truncate toward zero\n   - If fractional part > 0.5: round away from zero\n   - If fractional part = 0.5: round away from zero\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Round Half Up\n**Description**: Given a list of decimal numbers, round each to the nearest integer, but when equidistant, always round up.\n**Solution**: Similar to our main problem but simpler - always round up when fractional part is 0.5.\n```python\ndef round_half_up(numbers):\n    results = []\n    for num in numbers:\n        if num - int(num) >= 0.5:\n            results.append(int(num) + 1)\n        else:\n            results.append(int(num))\n    return results\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Banker's Rounding Implementation\n**Description**: Implement banker's rounding where 0.5 is rounded to the nearest even integer.\n**Solution**: Check if the integer part is even or odd when fractional part is exactly 0.5.\n```python\ndef bankers_round(value):\n    num = float(value)\n    integer_part = int(num)\n    fractional_part = abs(num - integer_part)\n    \n    if fractional_part < 0.5:\n        return integer_part\n    elif fractional_part > 0.5:\n        return integer_part + (1 if num >= 0 else -1)\n    else:  # fractional_part == 0.5\n        # Round to nearest even number\n        if integer_part % 2 == 0:\n            return integer_part\n        else:\n            return integer_part + (1 if num >= 0 else -1)\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Custom Rounding with Decimal Places\n**Description**: Round a number to a specified number of decimal places using the \"round half away from zero\" rule.\n**Solution**: Multiply by 10^decimal_places, apply our rounding logic, then divide back.\n```python\ndef custom_round(value, decimal_places):\n    multiplier = 10 ** decimal_places\n    num = float(value) * multiplier\n    integer_part = int(num)\n    fractional_part = abs(num - integer_part)\n    \n    if fractional_part < 0.5:\n        result = integer_part\n    elif fractional_part > 0.5:\n        result = integer_part + (1 if num >= 0 else -1)\n    else:  # fractional_part == 0.5\n        result = integer_part + (1 if num >= 0 else -1)\n    \n    return result / multiplier\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. First, convert the string input to a float to work with numeric values\n2. Extract the integer part and fractional part of the number\n3. Handle the special case where the fractional part is exactly 0.5 (equidistant)\n4. For the equidistant case, round away from zero by adding/subtracting 1 appropriately\n5. For non-equidistant cases, use normal rounding logic\n6. Return the final result as an integer\n\nThe key insight is recognizing that \"rounding away from zero\" means:\n- For positive numbers: round up when equidistant\n- For negative numbers: round down (more negative) when equidistant\n\n```python\ndef closest_integer(value):\n    '''\n    Create a function that takes a value (string) representing a number\n    and returns the closest integer to it.

Specifically, we need to:\n1. Split a string based on multiple delimiters (commas and spaces)\n2. Handle consecutive delimiters properly\n3. Remove empty strings from the result\n\nThe key algorithm involves using string methods like `split()` or regular expressions to separate the string into individual words.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### String Parsing and Tokenization\n\nString parsing is the process of analyzing and breaking down a string into meaningful components called tokens. In competitive programming, this is a fundamental skill used in many text processing problems.\n\n**Key Techniques:**\n\n1. **Basic Splitting**: Using `str.split()` with a single delimiter\n   ```python\n   text = \"apple,banana,orange\"\n   fruits = text.split(',')  # ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']\n   ```\n\n2. **Multiple Delimiters**: When dealing with multiple separators, we have several approaches:\n   - Replace one delimiter with another and then split\n   - Use regular expressions with `re.split()`\n   - Chain multiple split operations\n\n3. **Handling Whitespace**: The default `split()` method handles multiple whitespace characters intelligently:\n   ```python\n   text = \"hello    world  python\"\n   words = text.split()  # ['hello', 'world', 'python']\n   ```\n\n4. **Filtering Empty Strings**: After splitting, empty strings may appear due to consecutive delimiters:\n   ```python\n   # Filter out empty strings\n   result = [word for word in words if word]\n   # or\n   result = list(filter(None, words))\n   ```\n\n**Best Practices:**\n- Always consider edge cases like leading/trailing delimiters\n- Be aware of how different splitting methods handle whitespace\n- Use list comprehensions to filter results efficiently\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Word Pattern Matching\n**Description**: Given a pattern and a string s, return true if s follows the same pattern. A full match requires a bijection between a letter in pattern and a non-empty word in s.\n\n**Solution**: First tokenize the string into words, then check if there's a one-to-one mapping between pattern characters and words.\n```python\ndef wordPattern(pattern, s):\n    words = s.split()\n    if len(pattern) != len(words):\n        return False\n    \n    char_to_word = {}\n    word_to_char = {}\n    \n    for char, word in zip(pattern, words):\n        if char in char_to_word:\n            if char_to_word[char] != word:\n                return False\n        else:\n            if word in word_to_char:\n                return False\n            char_to_word[char] = word\n            word_to_char[word] = char\n    \n    return True\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Reverse Words in a String\n**Description**: Given a string, reverse the order of words while handling multiple spaces between words and trimming leading/trailing spaces.\n\n**Solution**: Split the string into words (automatically handles multiple spaces), reverse the list, and join back.\n```python\ndef reverseWords(s):\n    # Split automatically handles multiple spaces and removes empty strings\n    words = s.split()\n    # Reverse the list and join with single space\n    return ' '.join(reversed(words))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Valid Palindrome II\n**Description**: Check if a string can be a palindrome after deleting at most one character, ignoring non-alphanumeric characters.\n\n**Solution**: First extract only alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase, then check palindrome property.\n```python\ndef isPalindrome(s):\n    # Extract only alphanumeric characters\n    cleaned = ''.join(char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum())\n    \n    left, right = 0, len(cleaned) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        if cleaned[left] != cleaned[right]:\n            return False\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n    return True\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe problem requires splitting a string by commas or spaces. The most straightforward approach is to:\n1. First replace commas with spaces to normalize delimiters\n2. Use the default `split()` method which handles multiple consecutive spaces and automatically removes empty strings\n3. This approach correctly handles cases with mixed commas and spaces, as well as leading/trailing delimiters\n\nAlternatively, we could use regular expressions with `re.split()` to split by both delimiters simultaneously, but the replacement approach is simpler and more readable.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef words_string(s):\n    \"\"\"\n    You will be given a string of words separated by commas or spaces.

This prevents logical errors and ensures the problem constraints are met.\n\n### Even Number Detection\nAn even number is any integer that is divisible by 2. In programming, we use the modulo operator (%) to check this:\n- `n % 2 == 0` means n is even\n- `n % 2 == 1` means n is odd\n\n### Greedy Approach\nFor finding the maximum even number in a range, we can use a greedy strategy:\n- Start from the highest possible value (y)\n- Check if it's even; if so, return it\n- If not, check the next lower number (y-1)\n- Continue until we find an even number or exhaust the range\n\n### Mathematical Optimization\nInstead of checking every number, we can optimize:\n- If y is even, it's our answer\n- If y is odd, then y-1 is even (as long as it's still \u2265 x)\n- This reduces time complexity from O(n) to O(1)\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Find the Largest Odd Number in Range\n**Description**: Given two integers x and y, find the largest odd number in the range [x, y] inclusive, or return -1 if none exists.\n\n**Solution**: Similar to our main problem but looking for odd numbers. We start from y and check if it's odd. If yes, return it. If not, check y-1. We can optimize by noting that if y is even, y-1 is odd (if valid).\n\n```python\ndef largest_odd(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        return -1\n    \n    # If y is odd, it's our answer\n    if y % 2 == 1:\n        return y\n    # If y is even, check if y-1 is in range\n    elif y - 1 >= x:\n        return y - 1\n    else:\n        return -1\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Count Even Numbers in Range\n**Description**: Given two integers x and y, count how many even numbers exist in the range [x, y] inclusive.\n\n**Solution**: We can solve this mathematically. First, find the first even number \u2265 x and the last even number \u2264 y. Then use arithmetic progression formula.\n\n```python\ndef count_even_numbers(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Find first even number >= x\n    first_even = x if x % 2 == 0 else x + 1\n    \n    # Find last even number <= y\n    last_even = y if y % 2 == 0 else y - 1\n    \n    if first_even > y or last_even < x:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Count using arithmetic progression formula\n    return (last_even - first_even) // 2 + 1\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Sum of All Even Numbers in Range\n**Description**: Given two integers x and y, calculate the sum of all even numbers in the range [x, y] inclusive.\n\n**Solution**: Find the first and last even numbers in range, then use the arithmetic series sum formula: Sum = n(first + last)/2 where n is the count.\n\n```python\ndef sum_even_numbers(x, y):\n    if x > y:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Find first even number >= x\n    first_even = x if x % 2 == 0 else x + 1\n    \n    # Find last even number <= y\n    last_even = y if y % 2 == 0 else y - 1\n    \n    if first_even > y or last_even < x:\n        return 0\n    \n    # Count of even numbers\n    count = (last_even - first_even) // 2 + 1\n    \n    # Sum using arithmetic series formula\n    return count * (first_even + last_even) // 2\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. First, we validate the range by checking if x > y. If so, return -1 since it's an invalid range.\n2. We use a mathematical optimization approach:\n   - If y is even, it's the largest even number in the range, so we return y\n   - If y is odd, then y-1 is even. We check if y-1 is still within the range [x, y]. If yes, return y-1\n   - If neither condition is met, there's no even number in the range, so we return -1\n3.
