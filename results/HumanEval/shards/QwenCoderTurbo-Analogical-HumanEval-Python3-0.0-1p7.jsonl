If any number divides `n` evenly, then `n` is not prime.\n\n### Example Problems\n\n**Problem 1: Overlapping Intervals**\nGiven two intervals, determine if they overlap.\n\n```python\ndef overlap(interval1, interval2):\n    start1, end1 = interval1\n    start2, end2 = interval2\n    return max(start1, start2) <= min(end1, end2)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(overlap((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # True\n```\n\n**Problem 2: Length of Intersection**\nGiven two intervals, calculate the length of their intersection.\n\n```python\ndef intersection_length(interval1, interval2):\n    start1, end1 = interval1\n    start2, end2 = interval2\n    if overlap(interval1, interval2):\n        return min(end1, end2) - max(start1, start2) + 1\n    else:\n        return 0\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(intersection_length((1, 2), (2, 3)))  # 1\n```\n\n**Problem 3: Checking for Prime Numbers**\nGiven a number, determine if it is prime.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_prime(7))  # True\nprint(is_prime(8))  # False\n```\n\n### Solution to the Original Problem\n\n**Explanation of the Solution**\n1.

If a configuration does not lead to a valid solution, it is abandoned, and another one is tried.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n1. **DFS Algorithm**:\n   - Start at any given node (cell in our grid).\n   - Move to adjacent nodes recursively until you reach a leaf node or a dead end.\n   - Backtrack to the previous node and try the next unvisited node.\n\n2. **Backtracking Technique**:\n   - Maintain a current path that stores the sequence of visited cells.\n   - Recursively try all possible paths from the current node.\n   - If the path length equals `k`, check if it\u2019s lexicographically smaller than the best path found so far.\n   - If the path is longer than `k` or leads to a larger lexicographical value, backtrack.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Minimum Path Sum in Grid\n\nGiven a grid of size `n x n`, find the minimum path sum from top-left to bottom-right.\n\n#### Solution:\nWe use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to ensure we find the shortest path.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef minPathSum(grid):\n    n = len(grid)\n    queue = deque([(0, 0, grid[0][0])])\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y, path_sum = queue.popleft()\n        if x == y == n - 1:\n            return path_sum\n        \n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:\n                queue.append((nx, ny, path_sum + grid[nx][ny]))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Unique Paths II\n\nFind the number of unique paths from top-left to bottom-right in a grid containing obstacles.\n\n#### Solution:\nUse DP to keep track of paths, considering obstacles.\n\n```python\ndef uniquePathsII(obstacleGrid):\n    m, n = len(obstacleGrid), len(obstacleGrid[0])\n    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] == 0 else 0\n    \n    for i in range(1, m):\n        if obstacleGrid[i][0] == 0:\n            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0]\n    \n    for j in range(1, n):\n        if obstacleGrid[0][j] == 0:\n            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m):\n        for j in range(1, n):\n            if obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]\n    \n    return dp[-1][-1]\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Maze II\n\nGiven a maze represented by a 2D grid where `0` represents walkable cells and `1` represents walls, find the shortest distance from the starting point to the exit using BFS.\n\n#### Solution:\nUse BFS to explore all possible paths and find the shortest one.\n\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef nearestExit(maze, entrance):\n    m, n = len(maze), len(maze[0])\n    queue = deque([entrance + [0]])\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    while queue:\n        x, y, dist = queue.popleft()\n        if (x == 0 or x == m-1 or y == 0 or y == n-1) and dist > 0:\n            return dist\n        \n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and maze[nx][ny] == 0:\n                maze[nx][ny] = 1\n                queue.append((nx, ny, dist + 1))\n                \n    return -1\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n### Explanation:\nWe will use DFS to explore all possible paths of length `k` and keep track of the lexicographically smallest path.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n\n```python\ndef minPath(grid, k):\n    def dfs(x, y, path, step):\n        nonlocal result\n        if step == k:\n            if not result or path < result:\n                result = path.copy()\n            return\n        \n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:\n                dfs(nx, ny, path + [grid[nx][ny]], step + 1)\n    \n    n = len(grid)\n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    result = None\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(n):\n            dfs(i, j, [grid[i][j]], 1)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis code uses DFS to explore all possible paths of length `k` and keeps track of the lexicographically smallest path using a global variable `result`. The function iterates over every cell in the grid as a starting point and performs the DFS. Finally, it returns the smallest path found."], "prompt_tokens": [561], "completion_tokens": [1263], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

This involves:\n1. Handling the base case where `n=1`.\n2. Using recursion or iteration to compute the subsequent terms based on the given conditions.\n\n### Tutorial\n\n#### Recursion vs Iteration\n\n**Recursion**: A function calls itself directly or indirectly. It's a natural fit for problems involving sequences where each term depends on the previous terms. However, recursion can lead to high memory usage and stack overflow issues for large inputs.\n\n**Iteration**: Using loops (like `for` or `while`) to compute the sequence iteratively. This approach uses less memory but might be slightly more complex to implement.\n\nFor this problem, both approaches are feasible, but we'll use an iterative approach for simplicity and efficiency.\n\n### Example Problems\n\n1. **Fibonacci Sequence**\n   - **Problem**: Generate the Fibonacci sequence up to the nth term.\n   - **Solution**: Use an iterative approach with dynamic programming to store intermediate results.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def fibonacci(n):\n         fibs = [0, 1]\n         for i in range(2, n + 1):\n             fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])\n         return fibs[:n + 1]\n     ```\n\n2. **Lucas Sequence**\n   - **Problem**: Generate the Lucas sequence up to the nth term.\n   - **Solution**: Similar to Fibonacci, but starts with different initial values.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def lucas(n):\n         lucas_values = [2, 1]\n         for i in range(2, n + 1):\n             lucas_values.append(lucas_values[-1] + lucas_values[-2])\n         return lucas_values[:n + 1]\n     ```\n\n3. **Extended Tribonacci Sequence**\n   - **Problem**: Extend the Tribonacci sequence to handle negative indices.\n   - **Solution**: Use memoization to store computed values and handle negative indices using the recurrence relation.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def extended_tribonacci(n):\n         memo = {1: 3}\n         \n         def tribonacci(k):\n             if k in memo:\n                 return memo[k]\n             if k % 2 == 0:\n                 result = 1 + k / 2\n             else:\n                 result = tribonacci(k - 1) + tribonacci(k - 2) + tribonacci(k + 1)\n             memo[k] = result\n             return result\n         \n         return [tribonacci(i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n     ```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe initialize a list `result` with the first element `[1]`. We then iterate from 2 to `n`, computing each term based on whether the current index is even or odd. We append each computed value to the `result` list.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef tri(n):\n    # Initialize the result list with the first element\n    result = [1]\n    \n    # Iterate from 2 to n to compute each term\n    for i in range(2, n + 1):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            # If i is even\n            next_value = 1 + i / 2\n        else:\n            # If i is odd\n            next_value = result[i - 2] + result[i - 1] + result[i + 1] if i < n else None\n        result.append(next_value)\n    \n    return result\n```\n\nThis code correctly generates the Tribonacci sequence up to the nth term as specified."], "prompt_tokens": [400], "completion_tokens": [898], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

At the end, if no odd digit was found, the function should return 0.\n\n### Tutorial\n\n#### Iteration\nIteration is a method of repeating a process until a certain condition is met. In Python, we can use loops for iteration. The two types of loops are `for` loop and `while` loop.\n\n- **For Loop**: Used when the number of iterations is known or finite.\n- **While Loop**: Used when the number of iterations is unknown but depends on a condition being true.\n\n#### Conditional Checks\nConditional checks allow us to execute different blocks of code based on specific conditions. In Python, we use `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements to perform conditional checks.\n\nHere\u2019s a simple tutorial on how to implement iteration and conditional checks in Python:\n\n```python\n# Example: Finding the sum of numbers from 1 to 10 using a for loop\ntotal = 0\nfor i in range(1, 11):\n    total += i\nprint(total)  # Output: 55\n\n# Example: Checking if a number is prime\ndef is_prime(num):\n    if num <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):\n        if num % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\nprint(is_prime(7))  # Output: True\n```\n\n### Example Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: Sum of Even Numbers\n**Problem Statement**: Given a list of integers, return the sum of the even numbers.\n\n**Solution**: Use a `for` loop to iterate through the list and check if each number is even. If it is, add it to the sum.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_even_numbers(nums):\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n\n# Test cases\nprint(sum_of_even_numbers([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 6\nprint(sum_of_even_numbers([-2, 3, -4, 5]))  # Output: -6\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Count Odd Characters in a String\n**Problem Statement**: Given a string, count the number of characters that are odd.\n\n**Solution**: Iterate through the string and check if each character is odd by converting it to its ASCII value and checking if it is odd.\n\n```python\ndef count_odd_characters(s):\n    count = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if ord(char) % 2 != 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Test cases\nprint(count_odd_characters('abcde'))  # Output: 3\nprint(count_odd_characters('hello'))  # Output: 2\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Find the Largest Even Number\n**Problem Statement**: Given a list of integers, find the largest even number. Return -1 if there are no even numbers.\n\n**Solution**: Initialize a variable to store the largest even number found so far. Iterate through the list and update the variable if a larger even number is found.\n\n```python\ndef largest_even_number(nums):\n    largest_even = -1\n    for num in nums:\n        if num % 2 == 0 and num > largest_even:\n            largest_even = num\n    return largest_even\n\n# Test cases\nprint(largest_even_number([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Output: 4\nprint(largest_even_number([-2, 3, -4, 5]))  # Output: -2\nprint(largest_even_number([1, 3, 5]))  # Output: -1\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n**Explanation**:\nWe will iterate through each digit of the given number `n`. We'll convert the number to a string to easily access each digit. For each digit, we'll check if it's odd by converting it back to an integer and checking if it's not divisible by 2. If the digit is odd, we'll multiply it to a running product. If no odd digits are found, we'll return 0.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n\n```python\ndef digits(n):\n    product = 1\n    has_odd = False\n    for digit in str(n):\n        if int(digit) % 2 != 0:\n            product *= int(digit)\n            has_odd = True\n    return product if has_odd else 0\n\n# Test cases\nprint(digits(1))  # Output: 1\nprint(digits(4))  # Output: 0\nprint(digits(235))  # Output: 15\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the logic described above, solving the original problem efficiently."], "prompt_tokens": [239], "completion_tokens": [1066], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

This can be done using the exponentiation operator `**`.\n\n```python\nnumber = 3\nsquared = number ** 2  # Output: 9\n```\n\n**Summing Elements**: To find the sum of elements in a list, you can use the built-in `sum()` function.\n\n```python\nnumbers = [1, 2, 3]\ntotal_sum = sum(numbers)  # Output: 6\n```\n\n### Example Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: Round Off Numbers and Sum Them\n\nGiven a list of integers, round off each number to the next higher integer and calculate their sum.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Round each number to the nearest higher integer using `math.ceil`.\n- Sum the rounded numbers.\n\n```python\ndef sum_rounded_numbers(lst):\n    return sum(math.ceil(x) for x in lst)\n```\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nprint(sum_rounded_numbers([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 6\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Square and Sum\n\nGiven a list of integers, square each number and then sum them up.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Square each number using `x ** 2`.\n- Sum the squared numbers.\n\n```python\ndef sum_of_squares(lst):\n    return sum(x ** 2 for x in lst)\n```\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nprint(sum_of_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Combine Both Operations\n\nGiven a list of numbers, round each number up, square it, and then sum all the squared values.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Round each number to the nearest higher integer using `math.ceil`.\n- Square each rounded number using `x ** 2`.\n- Sum the squared numbers.\n\n```python\ndef sum_squared_rounded(lst):\n    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)\n```\n\n**Example**:\n```python\nprint(sum_squared_rounded([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n**Explanation**:\n- First, import the `math` module to use the `ceil` function.\n- Use a generator expression inside the `sum` function to apply `math.ceil` to each element in the list and then square it.\n- Return the result.\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef sum_squares(lst):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the sum of squares of elements in the list after rounding each element up.\n    \n    Args:\n    lst (list): A list of numbers.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The sum of squared numbers after rounding each element up.\n    \"\"\"\n    return sum(math.ceil(x) ** 2 for x in lst)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(sum_squares([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 14\nprint(sum_squares([1, 4, 9]))  # Output: 98\nprint(sum_squares([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 84\nprint(sum_squares([1.4, 4.2, 0]))  # Output: 29\nprint(sum_squares([-2.4, 1, 1]))  # Output: 6\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the required functionality, ensuring that each element in the input list is rounded up before being squared and summed."], "prompt_tokens": [326], "completion_tokens": [916], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

It's denoted by `n!`.\n\nFor example, \\(5!\\) (5 factorial) is:\n\\[ 5! = 5 \\times 4 \\times 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 120 \\]\n\nWe can implement this in Python using a simple loop:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(num):\n    if num == 0 or num == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, num + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n```\n\n#### Iterating and Multiplying\nOnce we have a function to calculate the factorial of a number, we can use it to compute the Brazilian factorial by iterating from `n` down to `1` and multiplying the results.\n\nHere\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n```python\ndef brazilian_factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        result *= factorial(i)\n    return result\n```\n\n### Example Problems\n\n#### Problem 1: Factorial of a Number\n**Problem**: Write a function to calculate the factorial of a given number.\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef factorial(num):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, num + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nprint(factorial(5))  # Output: 120\nprint(factorial(7))  # Output: 5040\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Sum of Factorials\n**Problem**: Write a function to calculate the sum of factorials of numbers from 1 to `n`.\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef sum_of_factorials(n):\n    total_sum = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total_sum += factorial(i)\n    return total_sum\n\n# Test cases\nprint(sum_of_factorials(3))  # Output: 9 (1! + 2! + 3! = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9)\nprint(sum_of_factorials(4))  # Output: 33 (1! + 2! + 3! + 4! = 1 + 2 + 6 + 24 = 33)\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Brazilian Factorial of a Number\n**Problem**: Write a function to calculate the Brazilian factorial of a given number.\n**Solution**:\n```python\ndef brazilian_factorial(n):\n    def factorial(num):\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(2, num + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n    \n    result = 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        result *= factorial(i)\n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nprint(brazilian_factorial(4))  # Output: 288\nprint(brazilian_factorial(5))  # Output: 34560\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n\n#### Explanation of the Solution\n- We define a helper function `factorial(num)` to calculate the factorial of a single number.\n- In the main function `special_factorial(n)`, we initialize a variable `result` to 1.\n- We iterate from `n` down to `1`, calculate the factorial of the current number, and multiply it with `result`.\n\n#### Python3 Code\n\n```python\ndef factorial(num):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(2, num + 1):\n        result *= i\n    return result\n\ndef special_factorial(n):\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n        result *= factorial(i)\n    return result\n\n# Test cases\nprint(special_factorial(4))  # Output: 288\nprint(special_factorial(5))  # Output: 34560\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the logic to calculate the Brazilian factorial as described in the problem statement."], "prompt_tokens": [262], "completion_tokens": [1137], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}

Additionally, we need to handle the special case where there are more than two consecutive spaces, which should be replaced with a hyphen (-) instead of multiple underscores (_).\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Iteration and Condition Checking:\nIteration allows us to go through each character in the string one by one. We can use a simple `for` loop for this purpose. For each character, we need to check if it's a space or not using an `if` statement.\n\n### String Concatenation:\nWe will build our resulting string by concatenating characters as we iterate through the original string. This can be done using the `+=` operator, which appends a value to the end of a string.\n\n### Handling Consecutive Spaces:\nTo handle consecutive spaces, we need a counter that increments every time we encounter a space and resets when a non-space character is encountered. If the counter exceeds 2, we append a hyphen to our result string; otherwise, we append an underscore.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Replace All Spaces in a String\n**Problem:** Write a function `replace_spaces(input_string)` that replaces all spaces in `input_string` with underscores (_) without considering any conditions.\n```python\ndef replace_spaces(input_string):\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char == \" \":\n            result += \"_\"\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Replace Multiple Consecutive Characters\n**Problem:** Implement a function `replace_consecutive_chars(input_string, max_count, replacement_char)` that replaces sequences of `max_count` or more occurrences of the same character with `replacement_char`.\n```python\ndef replace_consecutive_chars(input_string, max_count, replacement_char):\n    result = []\n    count = 0\n    prev_char = None\n    for char in input_string:\n        if char != prev_char:\n            count = 1\n            prev_char = char\n        else:\n            count += 1\n        \n        if count <= max_count:\n            result.append(char)\n        else:\n            result.append(replacement_char)\n    \n    return \"\".join(result)\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Simplified Version of the Original Problem\n**Problem:** Modify the original problem to only replace spaces with underscores and remove the condition for handling more than two consecutive spaces.\n```python\ndef simplified_fix_spaces(text):\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in text:\n        if char == \" \":\n            result += \"_\"\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n- We initialize an empty string `result` to store the final output.\n- We iterate through each character `char` in the input string `text`.\n- If `char` is a space, we append an underscore `_` to `result`.\n- If `char` is not a space, we simply append `char` to `result`.\n- Finally, we return the `result` string.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n```python\ndef fix_spaces(text):\n    result = \"\"\n    for char in text:\n        if char == \" \":\n            result += \"_\"\n        else:\n            result += char\n    return result\n\nprint(fix_spaces(\"Example\"))  # Output: \"Example\"\nprint(fix_spaces(\"Example 1\"))  # Output: \"Example_1\"\nprint(fix_spaces(\" Example 2\"))  # Output: \"_Example_2\"\nprint(fix_spaces(\" Example   3\"))  # Output: \"_Example-3\"\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the logic described above and solves the given problem efficiently."], "prompt_tokens": [271], "completion_tokens": [785], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

Specifically, elements at indices divisible by 3 are squared, elements at indices divisible by 4 but not by 3 are cubed, and no changes are made to other elements. The final step is to sum up all the modified elements.\n\n### Algorithm:\n1. Initialize a variable to hold the sum.\n2. Iterate through the list using enumeration to get both the index and value.\n3. Apply the appropriate operation based on whether the index is divisible by 3 or 4:\n   - If the index is divisible by 3, square the value.\n   - If the index is divisible by 4, cube the value.\n   - Otherwise, keep the value unchanged.\n4. Add the transformed value to the sum.\n5. Return the sum after processing all elements.\n\n### Tutorial:\nThis algorithm involves basic iteration, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and list manipulation. It's a great way to practice handling lists and performing calculations conditionally based on array positions.\n\n### Relevant Competitive Programming Problems:\n\n#### Problem 1: Array Transformation\n**Problem Statement:** Given an array of integers, transform the array according to the following rules: square elements at even indices, cube elements at odd indices, and leave them as is otherwise. Sum all the elements after transformation.\n\n**Solution:** Use a loop to iterate through the array, apply the conditions, and accumulate the result.\n\n```python\ndef transform_and_sum(arr):\n    total = 0\n    for i, num in enumerate(arr):\n        if i % 2 == 0:\n            total += num ** 2\n        else:\n            total += num ** 3\n    return total\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Special Index Operations\n**Problem Statement:** For a given list, double elements at multiples of 5, triple elements at multiples of 7, and subtract 1 from other elements. Calculate the sum of the transformed list.\n\n**Solution:** Iterate through the list, apply the conditions, and update the sum accordingly.\n\n```python\ndef special_operations(lst):\n    total = 0\n    for i, num in enumerate(lst):\n        if i % 5 == 0:\n            total += num * 2\n        elif i % 7 == 0:\n            total += num * 3\n        else:\n            total += num - 1\n    return total\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Conditional Squaring and Cubing\n**Problem Statement:** Implement a function that takes a list of numbers and returns the sum. Square numbers at multiples of 9 and cube numbers at multiples of 11.

Checking if a Number is Prime\nA prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. To check if a number is prime:\n- If the number is less than 2, it is not prime.\n- Iterate from 2 up to the square root of the number and check if the number is divisible by any of these values.

When encountering a closing bracket `]`:\n   - If the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening bracket `[`, pop the stack and continue.\n   - If the stack is empty after popping, this means there is no corresponding opening bracket for the current closing bracket, so return `False`.\n5.

It's useful for problems like this because it allows us to keep track of open brackets as we encounter them and ensure they are properly closed later. Here\u2019s how you can implement a stack in Python:\n\n```python\nclass Stack:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.items = []\n    \n    def push(self, item):\n        self.items.append(item)\n    \n    def pop(self):\n        if not self.is_empty():\n            return self.items.pop()\n        return None\n    \n    def peek(self):\n        if not self.is_empty():\n            return self.items[-1]\n        return None\n    \n    def is_empty(self):\n        return len(self.items) == 0\n    \n    def size(self):\n        return len(self.items)\n```\n\n### Example Problems\n\n1. **Valid Parentheses**:\n   - **Problem**: Given a string s consisting of just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.\n   - **Solution**: Use a stack to match each opening parenthesis with its corresponding closing parenthesis.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def isValid(s: str) -> bool:\n         stack = []\n         mapping = {\")\": \"(\", \"}\": \"{\", \"]\": \"[\"}\n         for char in s:\n             if char in mapping.values():\n                 stack.append(char)\n             elif char in mapping:\n                 if not stack or mapping[char] != stack.pop():\n                     return False\n             else:\n                 return False\n         return not stack\n     ```\n\n2. **Min Stack**:\n   - **Problem**: Design a stack that supports push, pop, top operations and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.\n   - **Solution**: Maintain two stacks, one for storing all elements and another for keeping track of the minimum values.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     class MinStack:\n         def __init__(self):\n             self.stack = []\n             self.min_stack = []\n         \n         def push(self, x: int) -> None:\n             self.stack.append(x)\n             if not self.min_stack or x <= self.min_stack[-1]:\n                 self.min_stack.append(x)\n         \n         def pop(self) -> None:\n             if self.stack[-1] == self.min_stack[-1]:\n                 self.min_stack.pop()\n             self.stack.pop()\n         \n         def top(self) -> int:\n             return self.stack[-1]\n         \n         def getMin(self) -> int:\n             return self.min_stack[-1]\n     ```\n\n3. **Longest Valid Parentheses**:\n   - **Problem**: Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', find the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.\n   - **Solution**: Use a stack to keep track of indices of unmatched parentheses.\n   - **Code**:\n     ```python\n     def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:\n         stack = [-1]\n         result = 0\n         for i, char in enumerate(s):\n             if char == '(':\n                 stack.append(i)\n             else:\n                 stack.pop()\n                 if not stack:\n                     stack.append(i)\n                 else:\n                     result = max(result, i - stack[-1])\n         return result\n     ```\n\n### Solution to the Original Problem\n\n**Explanation of the Solution**:\n- We use a stack to keep track of the positions of the opening brackets `[`.\n- As we traverse the string, if we encounter a closing bracket `]`, we check if the stack is not empty and the top of the stack is an opening bracket `[`. If so, we pop the stack. If the stack becomes empty after popping, it means there is no corresponding opening bracket, and we return `False`.\n- Finally, if the stack is not empty after processing the entire string, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, indicating a nested pair exists.\n\n**Python3 Code to Solve the Problem**:\n```python\ndef is_nested(string):\n    stack = []\n    for char in string:\n        if char == '[':\n            stack.append(char)\n        elif char == ']':\n            if not stack or stack[-1] != '[':\n                return False\n            stack.pop()\n    return len(stack) > 0\n```\n\nThis code checks for nested brackets by ensuring that every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket and that there are unmatched opening brackets left in the stack after processing the entire string."], "prompt_tokens": [297], "completion_tokens": [1145], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3"}

The challenge here is to handle different data types correctly, especially when dealing with string representations of real numbers that use commas instead of periods for the decimal separator. To address this, we need to convert all inputs to a common numeric format before comparison.\n\n### Key Steps:\n1. **Type Conversion**: Convert all inputs to floats for accurate comparison.\n2. **Handling Commas**: Replace commas in string representations with periods before conversion.\n3. **Comparison**: Compare the converted values.\n4. **Return Type Handling**: Return the value in its original type if they are not equal, otherwise return `None`.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\nTo solve this problem, we'll go through the following steps:\n\n1. **Input Types**: We have three possible input types: integer (`int`), float (`float`), and string (`str`). Strings may represent real numbers with either '.' or ',' as the decimal separator.\n\n2. **Conversion**:\n   - For integers and floats, no change is needed.\n   - For strings, replace ',' with '.' and then convert to a float.\n\n3. **Comparison**:\n   - After converting both inputs to floats, compare them.\n   - If they are equal, return `None`.\n   - Otherwise, return the larger value in its original type.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Ensure that only valid inputs (integers, floats, and strings representing valid numbers) are processed.\n   - Handle cases where the inputs cannot be converted to floats gracefully (e.g., invalid string formats).\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: [UVA 10005 - Big Number]\n**Problem Description**: Given two numbers, determine which one is larger. Both numbers can be very large and can be represented as strings.\n\n**Solution**: This problem requires converting string representations of large numbers to integers or floats for comparison. It demonstrates handling very large numbers and edge cases like invalid inputs.\n\n```python\ndef compare_numbers(num1, num2):\n    try:\n        n1 = int(num1)\n        n2 = int(num2)\n        if n1 == n2:\n            return None\n        elif n1 > n2:\n            return n1\n        else:\n            return n2\n    except ValueError:\n        print(\"Invalid input\")\n\nprint(compare_numbers(\"9876543210\", \"1234567890\"))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: [CodeChef - MAXSUM]\n**Problem Description**: Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any two elements in the array.\n\n**Solution**: This problem requires iterating over the array to find pairs of elements and calculating their sums. It demonstrates basic list manipulation and comparison.\n\n```python\ndef max_sum(arr):\n    max_val = float('-inf')\n    for i in range(len(arr)):\n        for j in range(i+1, len(arr)):\n            current_sum = arr[i] + arr[j]\n            if current_sum > max_val:\n                max_val = current_sum\n    return max_val\n\nprint(max_sum([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: [LeetCode - 189. Rotate Array]\n**Problem Description**: Rotate an array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.\n\n**Solution**: Rotating an array involves rearranging elements based on a given offset. This problem demonstrates array slicing and concatenation.\n\n```python\ndef rotate_array(nums, k):\n    k = k % len(nums)\n    nums[:] = nums[-k:] + nums[:-k]\n\nrotate_array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2)\nprint(nums)\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n1. **Convert Inputs**: Convert both inputs to floats after replacing commas in string representations.\n2. **Compare Values**: Check if the converted values are equal. If not, return the larger value in its original type.\n3. **Handle Equality**: If the values are equal, return `None`.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n\n```python\ndef compare_one(a, b):\n    # Helper function to convert string to float\n    def convert_to_float(val):\n        if isinstance(val, str):\n            val = val.replace(',', '.')\n        return float(val)\n    \n    # Convert both inputs to floats\n    a_float = convert_to_float(a)\n    b_float = convert_to_float(b)\n    \n    # Compare the values\n    if a_float == b_float:\n        return None\n    elif a_float > b_float:\n        return a\n    else:\n        return b\n\n# Test cases\nprint(compare_one(1, 2.5))  # \u279e 2.5\nprint(compare_one(1, \"2,3\"))  # \u279e \"2,3\"\nprint(compare_one(\"5,1\", \"6\"))  # \u279e \"6\"\nprint(compare_one(\"1\", 1))  # \u279e None\n```\n\nThis code handles various data types and edge cases while accurately comparing the values and returning the appropriate result."], "prompt_tokens": [306], "completion_tokens": [1073], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3"}
