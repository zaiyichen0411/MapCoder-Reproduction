However, there is an important observation: for any number **n ≥ 5**, the factorial of `n` will end in **0** because it includes the factors 2 and 5, which produce a trailing zero. So, the last digit of `n!` for `n ≥ 5` is always **0**.\n\nThis observation allows us to optimize the solution instead of computing the full factorial.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\nThe factorial of a number `n`, denoted `n!`, is the product of all positive integers from 1 to `n`. For example:\n- `5! = 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 120`\n- `6! = 720`\n\nThe last digit of a number is equivalent to the number modulo 10. So, to find the last digit of `n!`, we can compute `n! % 10`.\n\nHowever, for `n ≥ 5`, the factorial will always contain at least one 2 and one 5, which multiply to give 10. Hence, the last digit will be **0**.\n\nSo, the algorithm can be summarized as:\n- If `n >= 5`, return `0`.\n- Else, compute the factorial of `n` and return the last digit.\n\nThis is an efficient approach that avoids unnecessary computations.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Last Digit of Factorial**\n- **Problem Description:** Given a number `n`, find the last digit of `n!`.\n- **Solution:** As explained above, for `n >= 5`, the last digit is 0. For smaller values, compute the factorial directly.\n- **Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef last_digit_factorial(n):\n    if n >= 5:\n        return 0\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        result = (result * i) % 10\n    return result\n```\n\n### 2. **Last Non-Zero Digit of Factorial**\n- **Problem Description:** Given a number `n`, find the last non-zero digit of `n!`.\n- **Solution:** This is more complex. We need to avoid trailing zeros while computing the factorial. This involves removing factors of 5 and 2, and computing modulo 10 at each step.\n- **Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef last_non_zero_digit(n):\n    if n < 5:\n        return 1 if n == 0 else n\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n+1):\n        if i % 5 == 0:\n            continue\n        result = (result * (i % 10)) % 10\n    return result\n```\n\n### 3. **Number of Trailing Zeros in Factorial**\n- **Problem Description:** Given a number `n`, find how many trailing zeros `n!` has.\n- **Solution:** Count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to `n`. This is because there are always more 2s than 5s in a factorial.\n- **Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef count_trailing_zeros(n):\n    count = 0\n    while n >= 5:\n        n //= 5\n        count += n\n    return count\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n- The function `last_Digit_Factorial(n)` computes the last digit of `n!`.\n- For `n >= 5`, the last digit is always 0 due to the presence of factors 2 and 5.\n- For `n < 5`, compute the factorial directly and return the last digit.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef last_Digit_Factorial(n: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a python function to find the last digit in factorial of a given number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n >= 5:\n        return 0\n    result = 1\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result = (result * i) % 10\n    return result\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [208], "completion_tokens": [926], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_577_last_Digit_Factorial"}

Reversing a string is a basic operation that can be performed in several ways:\n\n- **Slicing**: `s[::-1]` is the most Pythonic and efficient way to reverse a string.\n- **Using `reversed()`**: This function returns an iterator that goes in reverse order, and you can convert it to a string using `\"\".join(reversed(s))`.\n- **Manual reversal**: Using loops to build a new string in reverse order.\n\nFor this problem, since we're dealing with a list of strings, we can use list comprehension to apply the reverse operation to each string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Reverse Words in a String (LeetCode 151)**\n\n**Problem Description**:\nGiven a string `s`, reverse the order of the words.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Split the string into words.\n- Reverse the list of words.\n- Join them back with spaces.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_words(s: str) -> str:\n    return ' '.join(reversed(s.split()))\n```\n\n### 2. **Reverse String (LeetCode 344)**\n\n**Problem Description**:\nWrite a function that reverses a string in-place.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Convert the string to a list of characters.\n- Use two pointers to swap characters from both ends towards the center.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_string(s: list) -> None:\n    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]\n        left += 1\n        right -= 1\n```\n\n### 3. **Reverse Vowels of a String (LeetCode 345)**\n\n**Problem Description**:\nReverse only the vowels in a given string.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Identify vowels in the string.\n- Use two pointers to swap vowels from both ends.\n\n```python\ndef reverse_vowels(s: str) -> str:\n    vowels = set('aeiouAEIOU')\n    s = list(s)\n    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1\n    while left < right:\n        if s[left] not in vowels:\n            left += 1\n        elif s[right] not in vowels:\n            right -= 1\n        else:\n            s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]\n            left += 1\n            right -= 1\n    return ''.join(s)\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `reverse_string_list` takes a list of strings as input. For each string in the list, we reverse it using slicing (`s[::-1]`), which returns a new string in reverse order. We use a list comprehension to apply this operation to all strings in the list.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef reverse_string_list(stringlist: List[str]) -> List[str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to reverse each string in a given list of string values.\n    \"\"\"\n    return [s[::-1] for s in stringlist]\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [212], "completion_tokens": [748], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_456_reverse_string_list"}

One of the most useful operations is **transposing** — taking a list of rows and converting it into a list of columns. For example, given:\n\n```python\n[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]\n```\n\nThe transposed version would be:\n\n```python\n[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]\n```\n\nThis can be done in Python by iterating through each sublist and collecting the first and second elements into separate lists.\n\nThe algorithm is straightforward:\n1.

The formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is derived from the fact that each ring adds $6n$ points, and the total is the sum of these rings plus the center point.\n\nThe formula:\n$$\nH(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1\n$$\n\nThis formula is efficient and allows us to compute the nth number in constant time, $O(1)$.\n\n---\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Centered Hexagonal Number (Similar to the original problem)\n\n**Description:**  \nGiven a positive integer `n`, return the nth centered hexagonal number.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse the formula $ H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1 $.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: Sum of First n Centered Hexagonal Numbers\n\n**Description:**  \nGiven a positive integer `n`, return the sum of the first n centered hexagonal numbers.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse the formula for the nth centered hexagonal number and sum it up from 1 to n.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef sum_centered_hexagonal_numbers(n: int) -> int:\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        total += 3 * i * (i - 1) + 1\n    return total\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3: Check if a Number is Centered Hexagonal\n\n**Description:**  \nGiven a number `x`, determine whether it is a centered hexagonal number.\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe can rearrange the formula $ H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1 $ to solve for `n` and check if it is an integer.\n\n$$\nH(n) = 3n^2 - 3n + 1 = x\n$$\n\n$$\n3n^2 - 3n + (1 - x) = 0\n$$\n\nUse the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{9 - 12(1 - x)}}{6}\n$$\n\n$$\nn = \\frac{3 \\pm \\sqrt{12x - 3}}{6}\n$$\n\nIf the discriminant is a perfect square and the resulting `n` is a positive integer, then `x` is a centered hexagonal number.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef is_centered_hexagonal(x: int) -> bool:\n    discriminant = 12 * x - 3\n    if discriminant < 0:\n        return False\n    sqrt_d = int(math.isqrt(discriminant))\n    if sqrt_d * sqrt_d != discriminant:\n        return False\n    n = (3 + sqrt_d) / 6\n    return n.is_integer() and n > 0\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe problem requires computing the nth centered hexagonal number using the formula $ H(n) = 3n(n - 1) + 1 $. This is a straightforward mathematical computation that can be done in constant time.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\ndef centered_hexagonal_number(n: int) -> int:\n    return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [201], "completion_tokens": [948], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_86_centered_hexagonal_number"}

The function must process a nested tuple structure, and for each element, it needs to check if it's an integer and whether it's even. If it is, it's included in the result. If it's another tuple, the function must recursively process it.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn competitive programming, handling nested data structures like tuples, lists, or dictionaries often requires **recursive traversal**. This is especially true when the structure is mixed (i.e., contains both integers and nested tuples).\n\nThe general idea is:\n\n1. **Base case**: If the current element is not a tuple, check if it's an integer. If it's even, return it.\n2. **Recursive case**: If the current element is a tuple, recursively process each element inside it.\n3. **Combine results**: Collect the even elements from the recursive calls and return them as a new tuple.\n\nThis technique is widely used in problems involving tree traversal, nested data processing, and recursive data structure manipulation.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. Flatten a Nested List\n**Problem**: Given a nested list of integers, write a function to return a flattened list of all the integers.\n\n**Solution**: Use recursion to traverse the nested list. If an element is a list, recursively flatten it. Otherwise, add it to the result.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef flatten(lst):\n    result = []\n    for item in lst:\n        if isinstance(item, list):\n            result.extend(flatten(item))\n        else:\n            result.append(item)\n    return result\n```\n\n### 2. Count Even Numbers in Nested Tuples\n**Problem**: Given a nested tuple with integers, count the number of even numbers.\n\n**Solution**: Traverse the tuple recursively. For each element, if it's a tuple, recurse. If it's even, increment the count.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef count_evens(t):\n    count = 0\n    for item in t:\n        if isinstance(item, tuple):\n            count += count_evens(item)\n        elif item % 2 == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### 3.

If the result is 0, then **all the bits in the range [l, r] are unset**.\n\n### How to create the mask?\n\nTo create a mask for the range [l, r], we can do:\n\n- Create a mask that has `r - l + 1` bits set to 1, starting from position 0.\n- Then shift this mask to the left by `l` positions.\n\nFor example, to create a mask for bits from position 2 to 4:\n\n- `0b111` (i.e., 7) is the base mask (3 bits set).\n- Shift it left by 2: `0b11100` (i.e., 28).\n\nSo the mask is `(1 << (r - l + 1)) - 1` shifted left by `l`.\n\n---\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Check if all bits in a range are set\n**Problem Description**: Given a number `n` and a range [l, r], check if all bits in that range are **set (1)**.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Create a mask for the range [l, r].\n- Use `n & mask == mask` to check if all bits in the range are set.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef all_bits_set(n: int, l: int, r: int) -> bool:\n    mask = (1 << (r - l + 1)) - 1\n    mask <<= l\n    return (n & mask) == mask\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: Check if a specific bit is set\n**Problem Description**: Given a number `n` and a position `k`, check if the bit at position `k` is set.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Use `n & (1 << k)` to check if the bit is set.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef is_bit_set(n: int, k: int) -> bool:\n    return (n & (1 << k)) != 0\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3: Toggle a specific bit\n**Problem Description**: Given a number `n` and a position `k`, toggle the bit at position `k`.\n\n**Solution**:\n- Use `n ^ (1 << k)` to toggle the bit.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef toggle_bit(n: int, k: int) -> int:\n    return n ^ (1 << k)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nTo check whether **all bits are unset** in the range [l, r], we:\n1.

While not directly related to IP addresses, it involves string parsing and manipulation, similar to what we do with IP segments.\n- **Solution:** Use a recursive approach to serialize the tree into a string and then parse it back into a tree structure.\n- **Code:**\n  ```python\n  class Node:\n      def __init__(self, val=None, children=None):\n          self.val = val\n          self.children = children or []\n\n  class Codec:\n      def serialize(self, root):\n          if not root:\n              return \"\"\n          res = []\n          def dfs(node):\n              res.append(str(node.val))\n              for child in node.children:\n                  dfs(child)\n              res.append(\"#\")\n          dfs(root)\n          return \" \".join(res)\n\n      def deserialize(self, data):\n          if not data:\n              return None\n          data = data.split()\n          def dfs():\n              if not data:\n                  return None\n              val = data.pop(0)\n              if val == \"#\":\n                  return None\n              node = Node(val)\n              while data[0] != \"#\":\n                  node.children.append(dfs())\n              data.pop(0)  # remove the \"#\"\n              return node\n          return dfs()\n  ```\n\n### 2. **LeetCode 1288. Remove Covered Intervals**\n- **Problem:** Given a list of intervals, remove any interval that is fully covered by another interval.\n- **Solution:** Sort the intervals by start time and then by end time. Iterate through the sorted list and keep track of the current end. If the next interval starts before the current end, it is covered.\n- **Code:**\n  ```python\n  def removeCoveredIntervals(intervals):\n      intervals.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))\n      res = [intervals[0]]\n      for start, end in intervals[1:]:\n          prev_start, prev_end = res[-1]\n          if start > prev_start and end > prev_end:\n              res.append([start, end])\n      return len(res)\n  ```\n\n### 3. **LeetCode 150. Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation**\n- **Problem:** Evaluate an expression written in reverse Polish notation (RPN).\n- **Solution:** Use a stack. For each token in the RPN expression:\n  - If it's a number, push it onto the stack.\n  - If it's an operator, pop two numbers, apply the operator, and push the result back.\n- **Code:**\n  ```python\n  def evalRPN(tokens):\n      stack = []\n      for token in tokens:\n          if token in \"+-*/\":\n              b = stack.pop()\n              a = stack.pop()\n              if token == '+':\n                  stack.append(a + b)\n              elif token == '-':\n                  stack.append(a - b)\n              elif token == '*':\n                  stack.append(a * b)\n              elif token == '/':\n                  stack.append(int(a / b))\n          else:\n              stack.append(int(token))\n      return stack[0]\n  ```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `removezero_ip(ip: str) -> str` processes an IPv4 address string and removes leading zeroes from each of its four segments. We split the IP on dots, loop through each segment, and for each segment, we:\n- Strip leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`.\n- If the result is an empty string (e.g., the segment was all zeroes), we replace it with `\"0\"`.\n- Rejoin the segments with dots.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\ndef removezero_ip(ip: str) -> str:\n    # Split the IP address into four segments\n    segments = ip.split('.')\n    # Process each segment to remove leading zeroes\n    result = []\n    for seg in segments:\n        if seg == '0':\n            result.append('0')\n        else:\n            # Remove leading zeroes\n            cleaned = seg.lstrip('0')\n            # If the segment was all zeroes, it becomes '0'\n            if cleaned == '':\n                result.append('0')\n            else:\n                result.append(cleaned)\n    # Join the cleaned segments with dots\n    return '.'.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(removezero_ip(\"192.168.001.001\"))  # Output: \"192.168.1.1\"\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [201], "completion_tokens": [1249], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_593_removezero_ip"}

Top K Frequent Words**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGiven a list of words, return the `k` most frequent words. For the same frequency, the word with the lexicographically smaller order comes first.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse a max-heap based on frequency and lexicographical order. Alternatively, use a min-heap of size `k` to keep the top `k` frequent words.\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom collections import Counter\n\ndef topKFrequent(words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:\n    count = Counter(words)\n    heap = []\n    for word, freq in count.items():\n        heapq.heappush(heap, (-freq, word))\n    \n    result = []\n    for _ in range(k):\n        result.append(heapq.heappop(heap)[1])\n    return result\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nTo find the `n` largest elements in a list and return them in **descending order**, we can use a **min-heap** of size `n`. We push each element into the heap, and if the size exceeds `n`, we pop the smallest element. This ensures that the heap always contains the `n` largest elements. Finally, we extract the elements from the heap and reverse them to get the result in descending order.\n\n### Python3 code:\n\n```python\nimport heapq\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef heap_queue_largest(nums: List[int], n: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Find the n largest integers from a given list of numbers, returned in descending order.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n == 0 or not nums:\n        return []\n    \n    heap = []\n    for num in nums:\n        heapq.heappush(heap, num)\n        if len(heap) > n:\n            heapq.heappop(heap)\n    \n    # Extract elements in ascending order and reverse to get descending order\n    return sorted(heap, reverse=True)\n```\n\n### Example usage:\n\n```python\nprint(heap_queue_largest([4, 5, 1, 3, 2], 2))  # Output: [5, 4]\nprint(heap_queue_largest([10, 2, 5, 1, 8], 3))  # Output: [10, 8, 5]\nprint(heap_queue_largest([3, 1, 4, 2], 4))  # Output: [4, 3, 2, 1]\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [222], "completion_tokens": [1291], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_4_heap_queue_largest"}

If no match is found, return `None`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of **O(n * m)**, where `n` is the length of the text and `m` is the length of the pattern.\n\n---\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **LeetCode 28. Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGiven two strings `haystack` and `needle`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`. Return `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse the brute force approach or the built-in `find()` method in Python. We can implement the brute force approach to understand the logic.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef str_str(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:\n    n = len(haystack)\n    m = len(needle)\n    \n    if m == 0:\n        return 0\n    if n < m:\n        return -1\n    \n    for i in range(n - m + 1):\n        j = 0\n        while j < m and haystack[i + j] == needle[j]:\n            j += 1\n        if j == m:\n            return i\n    return -1\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **LeetCode 459. Repeated Substring Pattern**\n\n**Problem:**  \nGiven a string `s`, check if it can be formed by repeating a substring multiple times.\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe can use the brute force method by checking if the string is composed of a repeated pattern. Another efficient way is to concatenate `s` with itself and check if `s` is a substring of the concatenated string (excluding the first and last character).\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef repeated_substring_pattern(s: str) -> bool:\n    return s in (s + s)[1:-1]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Codeforces 122A. Lucky Tickets**\n\n**Problem:**  \nA ticket is a string of length 6. A ticket is considered lucky if the sum of the first 3 digits is equal to the sum of the last 3 digits.\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe can generate all possible 6-digit numbers and check for the condition. However, for a more efficient approach, we can use a hash map to count the number of ways to get a sum for the first 3 digits and compare it with the last 3 digits.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict\n\ndef count_lucky_tickets():\n    count = 0\n    sum_counts = defaultdict(int)\n    \n    # Count all sums of first 3 digits\n    for i in range(1000):\n        s = sum(int(d) for d in str(i).zfill(3))\n        sum_counts[s] += 1\n    \n    # Check for all sums of last 3 digits\n    for i in range(1000):\n        s = sum(int(d) for d in str(i).zfill(3))\n        count += sum_counts[s]\n    \n    return count\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nThe function `occurance_substring` is designed to find the **first occurrence** of the `pattern` in the `text`. It returns a tuple of the matched substring, its starting index, and its ending index. If no match is found, it returns `None`.\n\nWe use a **brute force approach**:\n- Loop through the text from index 0 to `len(text) - len(pattern)`.\n- For each index, check if the substring from that index matches the pattern.\n- If a match is found, return the substring and its indices.\n- If no match is found, return `None`.\n\n---\n\n### Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Optional, Tuple\n\ndef occurance_substring(text: str, pattern: str) -> Optional[Tuple[str, int, int]]:\n    len_text = len(text)\n    len_pattern = len(pattern)\n    \n    if len_pattern == 0:\n        return (text, 0, 0)\n    if len_text < len_pattern:\n        return None\n    \n    for i in range(len_text - len_pattern + 1):\n        match = True\n        for j in range(len_pattern):\n            if text[i + j] != pattern[j]:\n                match = False\n                break\n        if match:\n            return (text[i:i + len_pattern], i, i + len_pattern)\n    \n    return None\n```\n\n### Example usage:\n```python\nprint(occurance_substring(\"hello world\", \"world\"))  # Output: ('world', 6, 11)\nprint(occurance_substring(\"abcde\", \"xyz\"))          # Output: None\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [233], "completion_tokens": [1258], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_773_occurance_substring"}

In this problem, we can use a memoized recursive approach to avoid recomputing the same subproblems.\n\nWe define `dp(i, prev)` as the number of valid sequences of length `i` where the last element is `prev`. The base case is when `i == n`, which means we've formed a valid sequence, so we return 1. For each recursive call, we iterate over all possible next elements that are at least twice the previous element and less than or equal to `m`. The total number of sequences is the sum of all these possibilities.\n\nWe can memoize the results of the `dp` function to avoid redundant computations.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Count of Subarrays with Sum Divisible by k**\n**Problem**: Given an array of integers, count the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by k.\n\n**Solution**: This problem can be solved using prefix sums and a hash map to track the frequency of remainders.

When comparing tuples, Python compares them lexicographically, which means it compares the first elements, and if they are equal, it moves to the next, and so on.\n\nHowever, in this problem, we are not comparing the entire tuples, but rather checking if **each element of the second tuple is smaller than the corresponding element in the first tuple**.\n\nFor example, given:\n```python\ntup1 = (5, 10, 15)\ntup2 = (3, 8, 12)\n```\nWe check:\n- 3 < 5 → True\n- 8 < 10 → True\n- 12 < 15 → True\n\nSince all are true, the function returns `True`.\n\nIf any element of `tup2` is greater than or equal to the corresponding element in `tup1`, the function returns `False`.\n\nThis is a simple yet powerful concept used in various algorithms, including sorting, checking constraints, and data validation.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Check if one list is a subset of another\n**Description:** Given two lists, check if every element in the second list is less than the corresponding element in the first list.\n\n**Solution:** Use element-wise comparison similar to the current problem.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef is_subset_less(list1, list2):\n    return all(x > y for x, y in zip(list1, list2))\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Validate a 3D coordinate\n**Description:** Check if a 3D coordinate (x2, y2, z2) lies within a bounding box defined by (x1, y1, z1).\n\n**Solution:** Ensure each coordinate of the point is less than the corresponding coordinate of the box.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef is_within_box(point, box):\n    return all(p < b for p, b in zip(point, box))\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Check for strictly increasing sequence\n**Description:** Determine if a list of numbers is strictly increasing.\n\n**Solution:** Compare each element with the next one.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef is_strictly_increasing(nums):\n    return all(nums[i] < nums[i+1] for i in range(len(nums)-1))\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `check_smaller` takes two tuples of three integers.

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the arrays, which is efficient for most cases.\n\nThis type of problem is often used as a foundation for more complex problems, such as checking for matching elements in different contexts, or counting matches under certain conditions.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **LeetCode 1365: How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number**\n**Problem Description:** Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]`, find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**  \nWe can use a nested loop approach where for each element, we count how many elements in the array are smaller. This is a basic comparison problem, similar to the original problem but with a twist of counting smaller elements.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    result = []\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        count = 0\n        for j in range(len(nums)):\n            if nums[j] < nums[i]:\n                count += 1\n        result.append(count)\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **LeetCode 1431: Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies**\n**Problem Description:** Given the array `candies` and an integer `extraCandies`, determine which kids can have the greatest number of candies if you give them all the extra candies.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**  \nWe find the maximum number of candies any kid has, then for each kid, check if adding the extra candies would make their total greater than or equal to the maximum.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef kidsWithCandies(candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:\n    max_candies = max(candies)\n    result = []\n    for candy in candies:\n        result.append(candy + extraCandies >= max_candies)\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **LeetCode 121: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock**\n**Problem Description:** You are given an array of prices where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on day `i`. You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy and a different day to sell.\n\n**Solution Explanation:**  \nThis is a variation of array comparison. We track the minimum price seen so far and calculate the maximum profit by comparing the current price with the minimum price.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef maxProfit(prices: List[int]) -> int:\n    min_price = float('inf')\n    max_profit = 0\n    for price in prices:\n        if price < min_price:\n            min_price = price\n        else:\n            max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)\n    return max_profit\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe problem requires us to count the number of indices where the elements of the two lists `nums1` and `nums2` are the same. We can achieve this by iterating through both lists using a loop, and for each index, comparing the elements. If they are equal, we increment a counter.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef count_same_pair(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Count the number of indices where the values in nums1 and nums2 are the same.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for i in range(len(nums1)):\n        if nums1[i] == nums2[i]:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [228], "completion_tokens": [911], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_723_count_same_pair"}

The key idea is to compute the **sum of digits** for each substring and check if it equals the **length of the substring**.\n\nTo efficiently count such substrings, we can use the **prefix sum technique**. For each position in the string, we maintain a running sum of the digits and use a hash map to track how many times each sum has occurred. This allows us to efficiently find the number of valid substrings ending at each position.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n### Prefix Sum and Hash Map for Substring Counting\n\nThe problem requires us to count substrings where the **sum of digits equals the length** of the substring. For example, in the string `\"123\"`, the substring `\"1\"` has a sum of `1` and length `1`, and `\"12\"` has a sum of `3` and length `2`, which is not valid. But `\"123\"` has a sum of `6` and length `3`, which is valid.\n\nTo solve this efficiently, we can use the **prefix sum** technique. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Convert the string to a list of integers**: Each character in the string is converted to an integer, e.g., `\"123\"` becomes `[1, 2, 3]`.\n\n2. **Compute prefix sums**: We compute a running sum of the digits as we iterate through the string.\n\n3. **Track the difference between prefix sum and index**: For each index `i`, the sum of digits from `0` to `i` is `prefix_sum[i]`. If we want a substring ending at `i` with length `l`, the sum of the digits in that substring should be `l`. So, the sum from index `j` to `i` is `prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]`. We want this to be equal to `i - j + 1`, which simplifies to `prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j] = i - j + 1` → `prefix_sum[i] - i = prefix_sum[j] - j`.\n\n4. **Use a hash map**: We use a hash map to count how many times each value of `prefix_sum[i] - i` has occurred. For each position `i`, we look up how many times `prefix_sum[i] - i` has been seen before and add that to the count.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Subarray Sum Equals K\n**Problem Description**: Given an array of integers and a target `k`, find the number of subarrays whose sum equals `k`.\n\n**Solution**: Use a prefix sum and hash map to count the number of times a certain prefix sum has occurred.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef subarraySum(nums, k):\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    count = 0\n    prefix_map = {0: 1}\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix_sum += num\n        if (prefix_sum - k) in prefix_map:\n            count += prefix_map[prefix_sum - k]\n        prefix_map[prefix_sum] = prefix_map.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Subarray Sums Divisible by K\n**Problem Description**: Find the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.\n\n**Solution**: Use a prefix sum and a hash map to count the number of times each modulo value has occurred.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef subarraysDivByK(nums, k):\n    prefix_mod = 0\n    count = 0\n    mod_map = {0: 1}\n    for num in nums:\n        prefix_mod = (prefix_mod + num) % k\n        if prefix_mod < 0:\n            prefix_mod += k\n        count += mod_map.get(prefix_mod, 0)\n        mod_map[prefix_mod] = mod_map.get(prefix_mod, 0) + 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Number of Substrings with Equal Number of 0s and 1s\n**Problem Description**: Given a binary string, find the number of substrings with an equal number of 0s and 1s.\n\n**Solution**: Treat 0 as -1 and use a prefix sum and hash map to count the number of times a certain sum has occurred.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef countSubstrings(s):\n    count = 0\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    sum_map = {0: 1}\n    for ch in s:\n        prefix_sum += 1 if ch == '1' else -1\n        if prefix_sum in sum_map:\n            count += sum_map[prefix_sum]\n        sum_map[prefix_sum] = sum_map.get(prefix_sum, 0) + 1\n    return count\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nWe convert the string into a list of integers (digits). Then, we compute the prefix sum of the digits. For each index `i`, we want to find substrings ending at `i` where the sum of digits equals the length of the substring. This is equivalent to checking if `prefix_sum[i] - i == prefix_sum[j] - j` for some `j < i`. We use a hash map to count the occurrences of `prefix_sum[i] - i` and accumulate the count.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\ndef count_Substrings(s: str) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    prefix_sum = 0\n    sum_map = {0: 1}  # To handle cases where prefix_sum - i == 0\n    for i, ch in enumerate(s):\n        prefix_sum += int(ch)\n        current = prefix_sum - i\n        count += sum_map.get(current, 0)\n        sum_map[current] = sum_map.get(current, 0) + 1\n    return count\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [210], "completion_tokens": [1269], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_61_count_Substrings"}

In programming, especially for competitive programming, we often need to compute this efficiently, especially when `b` is very large (e.g., up to 10^18 or more). The naive approach of multiplying `a` by itself `b` times is too slow for large values of `b`. To optimize, we use **exponentiation by squaring**, which reduces the time complexity from O(b) to O(log b).\n\nThis method works by recursively breaking down the exponent into smaller parts:\n- If `b` is even, then `a^b = (a^2)^(b/2)`\n- If `b` is odd, then `a^b = a * (a^2)^(b//2)`\n\nThis approach is efficient and widely used in problems involving large exponents.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Power of a Number (Leetcode 50)**\n**Problem Description:**  \nImplement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., x^n).\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe use the exponentiation by squaring method.

Remove every fourth number, and so on.\n\nThis process continues until the list is exhausted.\n\nThe key is to simulate the process step by step, maintaining a list and removing elements based on the current index.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Ludic Numbers Generation (LeetCode or similar)**\n\n**Problem Description:**  \nGenerate all Ludic numbers up to a given integer `n`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nWe simulate the process of removing elements from the list as per the Ludic number rules.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    if n < 1:\n        return []\n    \n    ludic = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    index = 1\n\n    while index < len(ludic):\n        next_index = index + 1\n        step = ludic[index]\n        remove_indices = set()\n\n        # Generate indices to remove\n        for i in range(step, len(ludic), step):\n            remove_indices.add(i)\n\n        # Remove elements from the list\n        ludic = [num for i, num in enumerate(ludic) if i not in remove_indices]\n        index += 1\n\n    return ludic\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes (Classic)**\n\n**Problem Description:**  \nFind all prime numbers up to `n`.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis is a classic problem solved using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which involves marking multiples of each prime starting from 2.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    if n < 2:\n        return []\n    \n    is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n\n    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i * i, n + 1, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n\n    return [i for i, val in enumerate(is_prime) if val]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Josephus Problem (Variation)**\n\n**Problem Description:**  \nIn a circle of `n` people, every `k-th` person is eliminated until only one remains. Find the last remaining person.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis is a classic recursive problem, and it can also be solved iteratively using a list simulation.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef josephus(n: int, k: int) -> int:\n    if n == 1:\n        return 0\n    return (josephus(n - 1, k) + k) % n\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nTo generate all Ludic numbers up to `n`, we simulate the process of removing elements from the list. We start with a list of numbers from 1 to `n`, and at each step, we remove every `i-th` number, where `i` is the current index in the list. The numbers that remain are the Ludic numbers.\n\nWe use a while loop to continue the process until the list is exhausted. We use a set to store indices to remove to avoid multiple passes through the list.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef get_ludic(n: int) -> List[int]:\n    if n < 1:\n        return []\n    \n    ludic = list(range(1, n + 1))\n    index = 1\n\n    while index < len(ludic):\n        step = ludic[index]\n        remove_indices = set()\n\n        # Generate indices to remove\n        for i in range(step, len(ludic), step):\n            remove_indices.add(i)\n\n        # Remove elements from the list\n        ludic = [num for i, num in enumerate(ludic) if i not in remove_indices]\n        index += 1\n\n    return ludic\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [214], "completion_tokens": [1112], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_603_get_ludic"}

The key idea is to efficiently calculate the contribution of each element in the array to the sum of products of all subarrays, without explicitly generating all subarrays (which would be too slow for large arrays).\n\nThis problem is typically solved using a **prefix product approach** and **combinatorics**, where for each element `arr[i]`, we determine how many times it contributes to the product of subarrays. This is done by tracking the number of subarrays ending at each index and multiplying the current element with the previous product.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\nThe problem of calculating the sum of products of all possible subarrays can be solved efficiently using a dynamic programming approach. Let’s consider an array `arr` of size `n`.\n\nFor each index `i`, we can compute the sum of products of subarrays ending at `i` using a variable `curr` that keeps track of the product of the current subarray ending at `i`. We also maintain a variable `total` that keeps the cumulative sum of all subarray products.\n\nThe recurrence is:\n- `curr = curr * arr[i] + arr[i]`\n- `total += curr`\n\nThis works because for each position `i`, the subarrays ending at `i` can be formed by extending the subarrays ending at `i-1` with `arr[i]`, or starting new subarrays at `i`.\n\nThis approach runs in **O(n)** time and **O(1)** space, making it efficient for large arrays.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Sum of Subarray Products** (Similar to the problem)\n**Problem Description:** Given an array of integers, find the sum of the product of all possible subarrays.\n\n**Solution:** Use the `curr` and `total` variables as described above. For each element, update `curr` to be the product of the current element with the previous `curr`, or just the element itself if it starts a new subarray.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef sum_of_subarray_products(arr):\n    total = 0\n    curr = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        curr = curr * num + num\n        total += curr\n    return total\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sum of Subarray Minimums** (LeetCode 907)\n**Problem Description:** Given an array of integers, find the sum of the minimums of all possible subarrays.\n\n**Solution:** Use a monotonic stack to find for each element how many subarrays it is the minimum of. This approach is more advanced and uses a **monotonic stack** to keep track of elements in a way that allows us to compute the number of subarrays where the current element is the minimum.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef sumSubarrayMins(arr):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    n = len(arr)\n    left = [0] * n\n    right = [0] * n\n    stack = []\n\n    # For left boundaries\n    for i in range(n):\n        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] >= arr[i]:\n            stack.pop()\n        left[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    stack = []\n    # For right boundaries\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] > arr[i]:\n            stack.pop()\n        right[i] = stack[-1] if stack else n\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        total += arr[i] * (i - left[i]) * (right[i] - i)\n        total %= MOD\n\n    return total\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Sum of Subarray Maximums** (LeetCode 907 variant)\n**Problem Description:** Given an array of integers, find the sum of the maximums of all possible subarrays.\n\n**Solution:** Similar to the previous problem, use a **monotonic stack** to find for each element how many subarrays it is the maximum of.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef sumSubarrayMaxs(arr):\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    n = len(arr)\n    left = [0] * n\n    right = [0] * n\n    stack = []\n\n    # For left boundaries\n    for i in range(n):\n        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] <= arr[i]:\n            stack.pop()\n        left[i] = stack[-1] if stack else -1\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    stack = []\n    # For right boundaries\n    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):\n        while stack and arr[stack[-1]] < arr[i]:\n            stack.pop()\n        right[i] = stack[-1] if stack else n\n        stack.append(i)\n\n    total = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        total += arr[i] * (i - left[i]) * (right[i] - i)\n        total %= MOD\n\n    return total\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nThe function `sum_Of_Subarray_Prod` calculates the sum of the product of all possible subarrays. We iterate through the array and, for each element, update the current product of subarrays ending at that index. The current product is updated as `curr = curr * arr[i] + arr[i]`, which accounts for both extending existing subarrays and starting new ones. We accumulate this into `total`.\n\n### Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef sum_Of_Subarray_Prod(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    total = 0\n    curr = 0\n    for num in arr:\n        curr = curr * num + num\n        total += curr\n    return total\n```\n\n### Example:\n\nFor `arr = [1, 2, 3]`:\n- Subarrays: [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [2], [2, 3], [3]\n- Products: 1, 2, 6, 2, 6, 3\n- Sum: 1 + 2 + 6 + 2 + 6 + 3 = 20\n\nThe function will return `20`."], "prompt_tokens": [236], "completion_tokens": [1367], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_734_sum_Of_Subarray_Prod"}

It can be used to check if a string contains the specified search pattern.\n\n### How to Extract Values Between Quotation Marks\nTo extract values between quotation marks, we can use the regex pattern `\"(.*?)\"`:\n\n- `\"` matches the opening quotation mark.\n- `.*?` is a non-greedy match for any characters (except newlines) between the quotes.\n- `\"` matches the closing quotation mark.\n\nIn Python, we can use the `re` module (regular expressions module) to find all matches of this pattern in a string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Extracting Quotes from a String**\n**Problem Description:** Given a string, extract all substrings that are enclosed in double quotes.\n\n**Solution:** Use regex to find all matches of `\"(.*?)\"`.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_values(text: str) -> List[str]:\n    return re.findall(r'\"(.*?)\"', text)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Parsing JSON-like Strings**\n**Problem Description:** Extract values from a string that resembles a JSON object, such as `\"name\": \"John Doe\", \"age\": 30`.\n\n**Solution:** Use regex to extract all quoted values.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef parse_json_values(text: str) -> List[str]:\n    return re.findall(r'\"(.*?)\"', text)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Extracting Tags from HTML**\n**Problem Description:** Given an HTML string, extract all values inside `title` or `meta` tags.\n\n**Solution:** Use regex to match and extract values inside the `content` or `title` attributes.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_html_tags(text: str) -> List[str]:\n    # Extract values inside title tags\n    titles = re.findall(r'<title>(.*?)</title>', text)\n    # Extract values inside content attributes of meta tags\n    contents = re.findall(r'<meta[^>]*content=\"([^\"]*)\"', text)\n    return titles + contents\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `extract_values` uses Python's `re` module to find all substrings that are enclosed in double quotes.

In this case, the function `recursive_list_sum` takes a list that may contain other lists, and it must sum all the integers, regardless of their nesting level.\n\nThe basic idea is:\n1. Iterate through each element in the list.\n2. If the element is an integer, add it to the sum.\n3. If the element is a list, call the function recursively on that sublist.\n4.

After obtaining the union, we sort the result to meet the requirement of outputting elements in sorted order.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn competitive programming, handling lists and sets is common. A **set** is an unordered collection of unique elements. When you take the union of two sets, you get all elements that are in either of the sets. To sort the result, we use Python's `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list from an iterable.\n\nThe steps to solve the problem are:\n1. Convert both input lists into sets.\n2. Use the `|` operator or the `union()` method to get the union of the two sets.\n3. Convert the resulting set back into a sorted list using `sorted()`.\n\nThis is a simple but effective approach that works efficiently for small to moderately sized lists.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **LeetCode 349. Intersection of Two Arrays**\n**Problem Description:** Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the intersection of the two arrays. The result should not contain duplicates and can be in any order.\n\n**Solution:** Use sets to find the intersection. Convert both arrays into sets, then use the `&` operator or `intersection()` method.\n\n```python\ndef intersection(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    set1 = set(nums1)\n    set2 = set(nums2)\n    return list(set1 & set2)\n```\n\n### 2. **LeetCode 202. Happy Number**\n**Problem Description:** A happy number is a number defined by a process: starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.\n\n**Solution:** Use a set to detect cycles. If the number is already in the set, it means we are in a loop and the number is not happy.\n\n```python\ndef is_happy(n: int) -> bool:\n    seen = set()\n    while n != 1 and n not in seen:\n        seen.add(n)\n        n = sum(int(digit)**2 for digit in str(n))\n    return n == 1\n```\n\n### 3. **Codeforces 71A. Way Too Long Words**\n**Problem Description:** You are given a list of words. For each word, if its length is more than 10, replace it with the first letter, the number of letters between the first and last, and the last letter.\n\n**Solution:** Use a loop to process each word, and for words longer than 10, construct the abbreviated version.\n\n```python\nn = int(input())\nfor _ in range(n):\n    word = input()\n    if len(word) > 10:\n        print(f\"{word[0]}{len(word)-2}{word[-1]}\")\n    else:\n        print(word)\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe take the two input lists, convert them into sets, find their union, and then sort the result.

We increment a counter whenever an `int` is found.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List, Union\n\ndef count_integer(list1: List[Union[int, str, float]]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.\n    \"\"\"\n    count = 0\n    for element in list1:\n        if isinstance(element, int):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [219], "completion_tokens": [586], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_253_count_integer"}

The key idea is to track both the **maximum** and **minimum** product subarrays ending at each position. This is because a negative number can turn a minimum product into a maximum product when multiplied by another negative number.\n\nWe maintain two variables:\n- `max_product`: the maximum product ending at the current index.\n- `min_product`: the minimum product ending at the current index.\n\nAt each step, we update these values based on the current element and the previous `max_product` and `min_product`.\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial:\n\nThe maximum product subarray problem is a classic example of dynamic programming. The challenge is to find a contiguous subarray whose product is the largest.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n1. **Negative numbers**: A negative number can flip a minimum product to a maximum product when multiplied by another negative number.\n2. **Zeroes**: If the array contains a zero, the product resets to zero. So, we need to handle zeroes carefully.\n3. **Track both max and min**: At each step, we track both the maximum and minimum product up to that point.\n\n### Steps:\n\n1. Initialize `max_product` and `min_product` to the first element.\n2. Initialize `result` to the first element.\n3. For each element from index 1:\n   - If the current element is negative, swap `max_product` and `min_product` (because multiplying by a negative number flips the max and min).\n   - Update `max_product` as `max(current_element, max_product * current_element)`.\n   - Update `min_product` as `min(current_element, min_product * current_element)`.\n   - Update `result` with the maximum of `result` and `max_product`.\n\nThis approach ensures that we consider all possible subarrays and their products.\n\n---\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Maximum Product Subarray (LeetCode 152)**\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest product, and return the product.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe use the dynamic programming approach described above. At each step, we track the max and min product, and update the result accordingly.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef maxProduct(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    max_product = min_product = result = nums[0]\n\n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        if num < 0:\n            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n        max_product = max(num, max_product * num)\n        min_product = min(num, min_product * num)\n        result = max(result, max_product)\n\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Maximum Product of Three Numbers (LeetCode 628)**\n\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven an array of integers, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the product.\n\n**Solution:**\nThe maximum product can come from either:\n- The three largest numbers.\n- The two smallest (possibly negative) numbers and the largest number.\n\nWe sort the array and compare the two possibilities.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef maximumProduct(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    nums.sort()\n    return max(nums[-1] * nums[-2] * nums[-3], nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[-1])\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Maximum Product Subarray with Zero (LeetCode 152 - with zero)**\n\n**Problem Description:**\nSame as LeetCode 152, but with the possibility of zeroes in the array.\n\n**Solution:**\nWe still use the same dynamic programming approach, but in the case of a zero, we reset the `max_product` and `min_product` to zero. However, the general approach remains the same.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef maxProduct(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n\n    max_product = min_product = result = nums[0]\n\n    for num in nums[1:]:\n        if num == 0:\n            max_product = min_product = 1\n        elif num < 0:\n            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n        max_product = max(num, max_product * num)\n        min_product = min(num, min_product * num)\n        result = max(result, max_product)\n\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nWe will implement the `max_subarray_product` function using the dynamic programming approach. At each step, we maintain the maximum and minimum product subarrays ending at the current index, and we update the result accordingly. This approach ensures that we handle negative numbers and zeroes correctly.\n\n### Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef max_subarray_product(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    if not arr:\n        return 0\n\n    max_product = min_product = result = arr[0]\n\n    for num in arr[1:]:\n        if num < 0:\n            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product\n        max_product = max(num, max_product * num)\n        min_product = min(num, min_product * num)\n        result = max(result, max_product)\n\n    return result\n```\n\n### Example Usage:\n\n```python\nprint(max_subarray_product([2, 3, -2, 4]))  # Output: 24\nprint(max_subarray_product([-2, 0, -1]))    # Output: 0\nprint(max_subarray_product([-2, 3, -4]))    # Output: 24\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [211], "completion_tokens": [1214], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_463_max_subarray_product"}

The most common ways to format strings are:\n\n1. **`str.format()`**: A method that allows you to insert values into a string using placeholders like `{}`.\n2. **f-strings (formatted string literals)**: Introduced in Python 3.6, f-strings provide a concise and readable way to embed expressions inside string literals.\n\nFor example:\n```python\n# Using str.format()\nformatted = \"Hello, {}\".format(\"World\")\n\n# Using f-strings\nformatted = f\"Hello, {'World'}\"\n```\n\nTo apply a format string to all elements in a list, you can use list comprehension:\n```python\nlist_ = [1, 2, 3]\nformatted_list = [f\"Item: {x}\" for x in list_]\n```\n\nIn the given problem, the function `add_string` is expected to take a list of any type (`List[Any]`) and a string format, and return a list of strings.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Format Numbers\n**Description**: Given a list of numbers, format each number with a prefix like \"Number: \" followed by the number.\n\n**Solution**: Use a list comprehension with an f-string to format each number.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef format_numbers(nums):\n    return [f\"Number: {num}\" for num in nums]\n\n# Example usage\nprint(format_numbers([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: ['Number: 10', 'Number: 20', 'Number: 30']\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: Format User Data\n**Description**: Given a list of user data (like name and age), format each user into a string like \"Name: [name], Age: [age]\".\n\n**Solution**: Use `str.format()` to insert the values.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef format_users(users):\n    return [\"Name: {name}, Age: {age}\".format(**user) for user in users]\n\n# Example usage\nusers = [{\"name\": \"Alice\", \"age\": 30}, {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"age\": 25}]\nprint(format_users(users))  # Output: ['Name: Alice, Age: 30', 'Name: Bob, Age: 25']\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 3: Format Time\n**Description**: Given a list of time values in seconds, convert them to strings like \"Time: X seconds\".\n\n**Solution**: Use f-strings for simple formatting.\n\n**Code**:\n```python\ndef format_time(seconds_list):\n    return [f\"Time: {sec} seconds\" for sec in seconds_list]\n\n# Example usage\nprint(format_time([10, 20, 30]))  # Output: ['Time: 10 seconds', 'Time: 20 seconds', 'Time: 30 seconds']\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `add_string` takes a list of any type and a string format.

After the loop, return `min_sublist`.\n\nThis approach has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where n is the number of sublists in the input list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Find the longest substring in a string**\n**Problem:** Given a string, find the longest substring without repeating characters.\n\n**Solution:** Use a sliding window approach to track the current substring, and keep track of the maximum length and corresponding substring.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef longest_unique_substring(s: str) -> str:\n    start = 0\n    max_len = 0\n    max_substring = \"\"\n    seen = {}\n\n    for end in range(len(s)):\n        if s[end] in seen and seen[s[end]] >= start:\n            start = seen[s[end]] + 1\n        seen[s[end]] = end\n        if end - start + 1 > max_len:\n            max_len = end - start + 1\n            max_substring = s[start:end+1]\n    return max_substring\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Find the sublist with the maximum sum**\n**Problem:** Given a list of integers, find the contiguous sublist with the maximum sum.\n\n**Solution:** Use Kadane's algorithm to compute the maximum subarray sum in linear time.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef max_subarray_sum(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    max_current = max_global = arr[0]\n    start = end = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] > max_current + arr[i]:\n            max_current = arr[i]\n            start = i\n        else:\n            max_current += arr[i]\n        if max_current > max_global:\n            max_global = max_current\n            end = i\n\n    return arr[start:end+1]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Find the sublist with the minimum sum**\n**Problem:** Given a list of integers, find the contiguous sublist with the minimum sum.\n\n**Solution:** Similar to Kadane's algorithm, but instead of maximizing, we minimize the current sum.\n\n**Code:**\n```python\ndef min_subarray_sum(arr: List[int]) -> List[int]:\n    min_current = min_global = arr[0]\n    start = end = 0\n\n    for i in range(1, len(arr)):\n        if arr[i] < min_current + arr[i]:\n            min_current = arr[i]\n            start = i\n        else:\n            min_current += arr[i]\n        if min_current < min_global:\n            min_global = min_current\n            end = i\n\n    return arr[start:end+1]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `Find_Min` is designed to take a list of lists (`lst`) and return the sublist with the minimum length.

Manual Parsing:\nLoop through each character in the string, and track whether you're inside a quote. When you find a quote, start collecting characters until the next quote.\n\n- Initialize a list to store the extracted values.\n- Use a flag (`in_quotes`) to track if we're inside a quote.\n- When a quote is found, start collecting characters until the next quote is found.\n\n### 2. Regular Expressions (Regex):\nUse a regex pattern like `\"(.*?)\"` to match all text between quotes. The `.*?` ensures a non-greedy match, so it stops at the first closing quote.\n\n- The `re.findall()` function in Python can be used to extract all matches of the pattern.\n- This approach is concise and efficient for simple cases.\n\nBoth methods are valid, and the choice depends on the use case and complexity of the input.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Problem: Extracting Quotes from a String (LeetCode 1208)**\n- **Problem Description**: Given a string, extract all values within double quotes.\n- **Solution**: Use regex to find all matches of text between quotes.\n- **Code**:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_quotes(text):\n    return re.findall(r'\"(.*?)\"', text)\n```\n\n### 2. **Problem: Parsing JSON-like Strings (HackerRank)**\n- **Problem Description**: Parse a JSON-like string to extract values in quotes.\n- **Solution**: Use a state machine to detect quotes and collect values.\n- **Code**:\n```python\ndef parse_quotes(json_str):\n    result = []\n    in_quotes = False\n    current = \"\"\n    for char in json_str:\n        if char == '\"':\n            in_quotes = not in_quotes\n            if not in_quotes:\n                result.append(current)\n                current = \"\"\n        elif in_quotes:\n            current += char\n    return result\n```\n\n### 3. **Problem: Extracting Attributes from HTML (Codeforces)**\n- **Problem Description**: Extract attribute values from an HTML string.\n- **Solution**: Use regex to find attributes like `class=\"...\"` and extract the values.\n- **Code**:\n```python\nimport re\n\ndef extract_attributes(html):\n    return re.findall(r'class=\"(.*?)\"', html)\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe will use **regular expressions** to extract all substrings that are enclosed in double quotes (`\"`).

The core algorithm involves checking for **rotation cycles** and using **string concatenation** to detect if a rotation results in the original string.\n\nKey concepts:\n- A string can be rotated by moving characters from the beginning to the end.\n- For a string `s`, if it can be rotated `k` times to get the original string, then the minimum such `k` is the answer.\n- A useful trick is to concatenate the string with itself and look for the smallest index where the original string appears again.\n\n## Tutorial:\nTo find the minimum number of rotations required to get the same string, we can use the following approach:\n\n1. Concatenate the string `s` with itself, resulting in `s + s`.\n2. Iterate through the concatenated string and check for the first occurrence of the original string `s` (excluding the 0th index, since we need at least one rotation).\n3. The index of the first occurrence of `s` in the concatenated string gives the minimum number of rotations.\n\nFor example, for `s = \"abc\"`, `s + s = \"abcabc\"`. The first occurrence of `\"abc\"` after index 0 is at index 3, which means 3 rotations are needed.\n\nThis is based on the idea that a rotation of a string will appear as a substring in the doubled string.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Minimum Rotations to Make a String Equal to Itself (LeetCode 1418)**\n**Problem:**  \nGiven a string `s`, find the minimum number of rotations needed to return to the original string.

Also, the lengths of `s1` and `s2` must be the same.\n\n**Python3 code:**\n```python\ndef is_rotation(s1, s2):\n    if len(s1) != len(s2):\n        return False\n    return s2 in (s1 + s1)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_rotation(\"abc\", \"cab\"))  # Output: True\nprint(is_rotation(\"abc\", \"acb\"))  # Output: False\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Find the Minimum Number of Rotations to Make a String a Palindrome (CodeChef)**\n**Problem:**  \nGiven a string `s`, find the minimum number of rotations required to make the string a palindrome.\n\n**Solution:**  \nFor each rotation, check if the resulting string is a palindrome. The minimum such rotation is the answer.\n\n**Python3 code:**\n```python\ndef is_palindrome(s):\n    return s == s[::-1]\n\ndef min_rotations_to_palindrome(s):\n    n = len(s)\n    for i in range(1, n):\n        rotated = s[i:] + s[:i]\n        if is_palindrome(rotated):\n            return i\n    return n\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(min_rotations_to_palindrome(\"abba\"))  # Output: 0\nprint(min_rotations_to_palindrome(\"abc\"))   # Output: 2\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `find_Rotations(str)` should return the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

To modify a string, we typically create a new string based on the original. One common operation is changing the case of characters in a string.\n\n- `str.lower()`: Converts all uppercase characters in a string to lowercase.\n- `str.upper()`: Converts all lowercase characters in a string to uppercase.\n- `str.title()`: Converts the first character of each word to uppercase and the rest to lowercase.\n\nThese methods are very useful in competitive programming when dealing with input that may not be in the expected case, such as in string comparison or pattern matching.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Check if a string is all lowercase\n**Problem Description**: Given a string, check if it contains only lowercase letters.\n\n**Solution**: We can iterate through each character in the string and check if it is lowercase using `char.islower()`.

If it does, we append `newch` to the result, otherwise we append the original character.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\ndef replace_char(str1: str, ch: str, newch: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to replace characters in a string.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = []\n    for char in str1:\n        if char == ch:\n            result.append(newch)\n        else:\n            result.append(char)\n    return ''.join(result)\n\n# Example usage:\n# print(replace_char(\"hello world\", \"o\", \"x\"))  # Output: \"hellx wxrld\"\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [208], "completion_tokens": [716], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_474_replace_char"}

The function needs to check whether a given number is greater than **all** elements in an array. This is a straightforward logical check, but it can be optimized by using built-in functions like `all()` in Python.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe function `check_greater` is designed to compare a single number against all elements in a list. The core idea is to iterate through the array and check if the number is greater than each element. If it is, then the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.\n\nIn Python, you can use the `all()` function to simplify the logic. The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in an iterable are `True`. So, for each element in the array, we can check if `number > element`, and use `all()` to verify that all of these comparisons are `True`.\n\nFor example:\n```python\nall(number > x for x in arr)\n```\nThis expression will return `True` only if the number is greater than every element in the array.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Check if all elements are less than a given number**\n**Problem Description:**  \nGiven an array of integers and a number, determine if all elements in the array are less than the number.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis is exactly the same as the original problem. We can use the `all()` function to check if all elements in the array are less than the given number.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef check_greater(arr: List[int], number: int) -> bool:\n    return all(number > x for x in arr)\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Find the maximum of an array**\n**Problem Description:**  \nGiven an array of integers, find the maximum value.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis is a classic problem that can be solved with a simple loop or using the built-in `max()` function. However, we can also use the `all()` function in a creative way to find the maximum. For example, if we have a candidate value, we can check if it's greater than all elements in the array. If it is, then it's the maximum.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef find_max(arr: List[int]) -> int:\n    for num in arr:\n        if all(num > x for x in arr):\n            return num\n    return arr[0]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Check if an array is strictly increasing**\n**Problem Description:**  \nGiven an array of integers, determine if the array is strictly increasing (each element is greater than the previous one).\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis problem can be solved by checking whether each element is greater than the previous one. We can use a loop or list comprehension with `all()` to verify this.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef is_strictly_increasing(arr: List[int]) -> bool:\n    return all(arr[i] > arr[i - 1] for i in range(1, len(arr)))\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `check_greater` needs to check if the given `number` is greater than **all** elements in the `arr`.

This can be used to filter out specific characters.\n\nFor example, to remove lowercase letters from a string:\n- Loop through each character.\n- If the character is not lowercase, add it to a result string.\n- Return the result string.\n\nThis is a simple yet powerful technique used in many string-related problems, such as filtering out specific character types (lowercase, uppercase, digits, etc.).\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Remove Uppercase Letters\n**Description:** Given a string, remove all uppercase letters and return the modified string.\n\n**Solution:** Use `isupper()` to check for uppercase characters and skip them.\n\n```python\ndef remove_uppercase(s: str) -> str:\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if not char.isupper())\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Remove Digits\n**Description:** Remove all digits from a string.\n\n**Solution:** Use `isdigit()` to check if a character is a digit and skip it.\n\n```python\ndef remove_digits(s: str) -> str:\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if not char.isdigit())\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Remove All Non-Alphanumeric Characters\n**Description:** Remove all characters that are not letters or digits.\n\n**Solution:** Use `isalnum()` to check if a character is a letter or digit.\n\n```python\ndef remove_non_alphanumeric(s: str) -> str:\n    return ''.join(char for char in s if char.isalnum())\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `remove_lowercase` takes a string `str1` as input. It iterates through each character in the string and checks if it is lowercase using the `islower()` method. If it is **not** lowercase, the character is included in the result string. This is efficiently done using a list comprehension or a generator expression.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\ndef remove_lowercase(str1: str) -> str:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.\n    \"\"\"\n    return ''.join(char for char in str1 if not char.islower())\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [202], "completion_tokens": [590], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_478_remove_lowercase"}

The solution involves iterating through each character and computing the value based on the position.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef title_to_number(column_title: str) -> int:\n    result = 0\n    for char in column_title:\n        result = result * 26 + (ord(char) - ord('A') + 1)\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **LeetCode 168. Excel Sheet Column Name**\n**Problem Description**: Given an integer `n`, return the corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet. For example, 1 = \"A\", 2 = \"B\", ..., 26 = \"Z\", 27 = \"AA\", etc.\n\n**Solution**:\nThis problem is the reverse of the previous one. Instead of converting from base-26 to base-10, we need to convert from base-10 to base-26. This is similar to converting a number to a binary string, but with base-26.\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef convert_to_title(n: int) -> str:\n    result = \"\"\n    while n > 0:\n        n -= 1\n        remainder = n % 26\n        result = chr(65 + remainder) + result\n        n = n // 26\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **LeetCode 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal**\n**Problem Description**: Given an integer, return its hexadecimal representation as a string. For example, `255` should return `\"ff\"`.\n\n**Solution**:\nThis problem involves converting a decimal number to a hexadecimal (base-16) string. The process is similar to binary conversion, but with a base of 16 and different digit mapping (0-9, a-f).\n\n**Python3 Code**:\n```python\ndef to_hex(num: int) -> str:\n    if num == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    hex_chars = \"0123456789abcdef\"\n    result = \"\"\n    while num > 0:\n        result = hex_chars[num % 16] + result\n        num = num // 16\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `decimal_to_binary` takes an integer `n` and returns its binary representation as a string with no leading zeros. The algorithm:\n- Handles the case where `n == 0` separately.\n- Uses a loop to divide `n` by 2 and collect the remainders.\n- Reverses the collected remainders to get the correct binary string.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\ndef decimal_to_binary(n: int) -> str:\n    if n == 0:\n        return \"0\"\n    binary = \"\"\n    while n > 0:\n        binary = str(n % 2) + binary\n        n = n // 2\n    return binary\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [212], "completion_tokens": [976], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_99_decimal_to_binary"}

Since the array is sorted, and we are looking for an element that appears exactly once, we can leverage the properties of a sorted array and the binary search algorithm to efficiently find the unique element.\n\nThe key insight is that in a sorted array where every element appears exactly twice except one, the unique element breaks the pattern of pairs. For example, if the array is `[1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the unique element is `2`. The binary search approach exploits the fact that for the first occurrence of a pair, the left index is even and the right index is odd. If this pattern is broken, the unique element is on the left side.\n\n## Tutorial:\nBinary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. In this problem, we are not searching for a specific value, but instead, we are searching for the position where the pattern of pairs breaks.\n\nHere's the idea:\n- Initialize `left = 0` and `right = len(arr) - 1`.\n- While `left < right`:\n  - Compute the middle index `mid`.\n  - Check if `arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1]`. The `^` operator is used to determine if the index is even or odd. If `mid` is even, `mid ^ 1` gives the next index (odd), and if `mid` is odd, it gives the previous index (even).\n  - If `arr[mid] == arr[mid ^ 1]`, the unique element is to the right of `mid`, so set `left = mid + 1`.\n  - Otherwise, the unique element is to the left of `mid`, so set `right = mid`.\n- When the loop ends, `left` will point to the unique element.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **LeetCode 136.

For example, summing all negative numbers in a list requires:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable to hold the sum (e.g., `total = 0`).\n2. **Iteration**: Loop through each element in the list.\n3. **Condition Check**: For each element, check if it is less than zero.\n4. **Accumulation**: If the number is negative, add it to the total.\n5. **Return**: After the loop, return the total.\n\nThis is a straightforward approach that can be applied to a wide range of similar problems such as counting elements, filtering, or aggregating values based on conditions.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **Sum of Positive Numbers**\n**Problem**: Given a list of integers, return the sum of all positive numbers.\n\n**Solution**: Similar to the original problem, but instead of checking for negative numbers, we check for numbers greater than zero.\n\n```python\ndef sum_positive(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num > 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```\n\n### 2. **Count of Even Numbers**\n**Problem**: Count the number of even integers in a list.\n\n**Solution**: Iterate through the list, check if each number is even using `num % 2 == 0`, and increment a counter.\n\n```python\ndef count_evens(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    count = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num % 2 == 0:\n            count += 1\n    return count\n```\n\n### 3. **Sum of Digits in a Number**\n**Problem**: Given a list of integers, return the sum of all digits in all numbers.\n\n**Solution**: For each number, convert it to a string, iterate through each character, convert it back to an integer, and add it to the total.\n\n```python\ndef sum_digits(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        for ch in str(abs(num)):\n            total += int(ch)\n    return total\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `sum_negativenum` takes a list of integers as input. It initializes a variable `total` to 0. Then it iterates over each number in the list. If a number is less than 0, it adds it to `total`. Finally, it returns `total`.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef sum_negativenum(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to calculate the sum of the negative numbers of a given list of numbers.\n    \"\"\"\n    total = 0\n    for num in nums:\n        if num < 0:\n            total += num\n    return total\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [215], "completion_tokens": [682], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_133_sum_negativenum"}

To determine if a number has odd parity, we check whether the number of 1s in its binary representation is odd. However, for the specific problem of checking if the **parity is odd**, we can simplify it by checking if the number is **odd** (i.e., the least significant bit is 1). This can be done efficiently using `x & 1`, which returns 1 if the number is odd, and 0 if it is even.\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn competitive programming, bitwise operations are very powerful and efficient. The `&` (bitwise AND) operator is used to check if a particular bit is set. For example, `x & 1` checks the least significant bit (LSB) of the number `x`. If the result is 1, it means the number is odd; if it's 0, the number is even. This is a fast and simple way to determine the parity of a number.\n\nThis concept is used in many problems, such as:\n- Determining if a number is even or odd.\n- Counting the number of set bits (1s) in a number.\n- Checking if a number is a power of two.\n- Swapping numbers without a temporary variable.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd\n**Problem Description:**  \nGiven an integer `x`, determine if it is even or odd.\n\n**Solution:**  \nUse `x % 2` or `x & 1`.

Merge all of them into one, and for overlapping keys, use the value from the last dictionary.\n\n**Solution:**\nIterate through all the dictionaries, and for each, update the merged dictionary.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n\n```python\ndef merge_multiple_dicts(dicts):\n    merged = {}\n    for d in dicts:\n        merged.update(d)\n    return merged\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Merge with Priority (AtCoder ABC 123C)**\n\n**Problem Description:**\nMerge multiple dictionaries, and for overlapping keys, use the value from the dictionary with the highest priority (i.e., the first one in the list).\n\n**Solution:**\nIterate through the dictionaries in reverse order and update the merged dictionary. This ensures that earlier dictionaries' values are overwritten by later ones if there are conflicts.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n\n```python\ndef merge_with_priority(dicts):\n    merged = {}\n    for d in reversed(dicts):\n        merged.update(d)\n    return merged\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n\nWe are given three dictionaries, and we need to merge them into one. The function should return a dictionary where keys from the later dictionaries overwrite the keys from earlier ones. We can use the dictionary unpacking operator `**` to merge them directly.\n\n### Python3 code:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import Dict\n\ndef merge_dictionaries_three(dict1: Dict[str, str], dict2: Dict[str, str], dict3: Dict[str, str]) -> Dict[str, str]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Merge three dictionaries into a single dictionary.\n    If keys are repeated, the values from the later dictionaries will overwrite the earlier ones.\n    \"\"\"\n    return {**dict1, **dict2, **dict3}\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [230], "completion_tokens": [759], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "task_id": "mbpp_87_merge_dictionaries_three"}

To modify a string, we need to create a new string. The `find()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of a substring, and `rfind()` returns the index of the last occurrence. These are very useful for tasks like this.\n\nThe approach is as follows:\n1. Find the index of the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(ch)`.\n2. Find the index of the last occurrence of the character using `s.rfind(ch)`.\n3. If the character is not found, return the original string.\n4.

The idea is to iterate through a list and select elements that meet a certain condition. In Python, this can be done using **list comprehensions**, which are concise and efficient.\n\nFor example, to filter odd numbers from a list, we can check for each number if it is not divisible by 2.

For each number in the array, check if `num * 2` is in the set, or if `num / 2` is in the set (if `num` is even).

Then, for each child, we check if `candies[i] + extraCandies >= max_candies`. This is a simple **filtering and comparison** problem.\n\n```python\ndef kidsWithCandies(candies: List[int], extraCandies: int) -> List[bool]:\n    max_candies = max(candies)\n    return [c + extraCandies >= max_candies for c in candies]\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **LeetCode 1281.

A string is a sequence of characters, and each character has an index starting from 0. To remove characters at odd indices, we can loop through the string and collect characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) into a new string.\n\nFor example, if the input is `\"abcdef\"`, the characters at even indices are:\n- index 0: `'a'`\n- index 2: `'c'`\n- index 4: `'e'`\n\nSo the output would be `\"ace\"`.\n\nThis is a simple but important concept, and it's often used in more complex string problems such as pattern matching, substring operations, and string transformations.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Remove Even Index Characters\n**Description:** Given a string, return a new string that contains only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).\n\n**Solution:** Iterate over the string using a loop, and for each index, check if it is even.

This builds the required dictionary.\n\n### Python3 code:\n```python\nfrom typing import Tuple, Dict\n\ndef tuple_to_dict(test_tup: Tuple[int, int, int, int, int, int]) -> Dict[int, int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Convert the given tuple to a key-value dictionary using adjacent elements.\n    \"\"\"\n    result = {}\n    for i in range(0, len(test_tup), 2):\n        result[test_tup[i]] = test_tup[i + 1]\n    return result\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [251], "completion_tokens": [789], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_740_tuple_to_dict"}

The core concepts used here are:\n- **Binary Search**: Efficiently find the missing number in O(log n) time.\n- **Index-Value Relationship**: Since the list is sorted and contains natural numbers (starting from 1), the value at index `i` should be `i + 1`. If this is not the case, the missing number is somewhere before that index.\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial:\nIn a **sorted list of natural numbers**, the numbers start from 1 and increase by 1. For example: `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` – the smallest missing number is `4`.\n\nIf the list is sorted, we can use **binary search** to efficiently find the missing number. The key idea is to check if the value at the middle index is equal to the expected value (i.e., `mid + 1`). If it's not, the missing number must be in the left half. Otherwise, it's in the right half.\n\n### Steps:\n1. Initialize `left = 0` and `right = len(array) - 1`.\n2. While `left <= right`:\n   - Compute `mid = (left + right) // 2`.\n   - If `array[mid] == mid + 1`, the missing number is on the right.\n   - Else, the missing number is on the left.\n3. After the loop, the missing number is `left + 1`.\n\n---\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **LeetCode 268. Missing Number**\n**Problem Description**: Given an array of `n` distinct numbers from `0` to `n`, find the missing number.\n\n**Solution**: Since the array contains numbers from `0` to `n` (inclusive), the length of the array is `n`, and the missing number is the one not in the array. We can use the formula: `expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2`, and subtract the actual sum of the array.\n\n```python\ndef missingNumber(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    n = len(nums)\n    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2\n    return expected_sum - sum(nums)\n```\n\n### 2. **LeetCode 41. First Missing Positive**\n**Problem Description**: Given an unsorted array of integers, find the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array.\n\n**Solution**: Use in-place hashing. For each element, if it is in the range [1, n], place it at its correct index (i.e., `nums[i]` should be at `nums[nums[i] - 1]`). After this, the first index where the value doesn't match the index + 1 is the missing number.\n\n```python\ndef firstMissingPositive(nums: List[int]) -> int:\n    n = len(nums)\n    for i in range(n):\n        while 1 <= nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:\n            nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]\n    for i in range(n):\n        if nums[i] != i + 1:\n            return i + 1\n    return n + 1\n```\n\n### 3. **Codeforces 1373B. 01 Game**\n**Problem Description**: Given a binary string, find the number of operations to make it all 0s. Each operation is to remove two adjacent characters, one '0' and one '1'.\n\n**Solution**: Use a stack. For each character, if the top of the stack is different from the current character, pop the top (as a pair), else push the current character. The number of remaining characters is the answer.\n\n```python\ndef countOperations(s: str) -> int:\n    stack = []\n    for c in s:\n        if stack and stack[-1] != c:\n            stack.pop()\n        else:\n            stack.append(c)\n    return len(stack)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe use **binary search** to find the smallest missing number in a **sorted list of natural numbers**.

The algorithm works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. Here's how it works for finding the left insertion point:\n\n1. Initialize `low = 0` and `high = len(a)`.\n2. While `low < high`:\n   - Compute `mid = (low + high) // 2`.\n   - If `a[mid] < x`, then `x` should be inserted after `mid`, so set `low = mid + 1`.\n   - Else (i.e., `a[mid] >= x`), `x` should be inserted before or at `mid`, so set `high = mid`.\n3. When the loop ends, `low` is the left insertion point.\n\nThis approach ensures that we find the first index where `x` can be inserted without violating the sorted order.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. LeetCode - Search Insert Position\n**Problem:** Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found.

Codeforces - Find the Position\n**Problem:** Given a sorted array, find the index where a given value would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.\n\n**Solution:** Same as the `bisect_left` logic.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef find_position(a, x):\n    low, high = 0, len(a)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if a[mid] < x:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. HackerRank - Insertion Position\n**Problem:** Given a sorted list, find the index where a new element should be inserted to keep the list sorted.\n\n**Solution:** Use binary search to find the left insertion point.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\ndef insertion_position(a, x):\n    low, high = 0, len(a)\n    while low < high:\n        mid = (low + high) // 2\n        if a[mid] < x:\n            low = mid + 1\n        else:\n            high = mid\n    return low\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nWe implement the `left_insertion` function using binary search.

For example, given `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`, the result should be `[[1, 1], [2, 2], [3]]`.\n\nTo implement this:\n1. Initialize an empty result list.\n2. Initialize a temporary list to hold the current group of elements.\n3. Iterate through the input list:\n   - If the current element is the same as the last element in the temporary list, add it to the temporary list.\n   - If it's different, add the temporary list to the result and start a new temporary list with the current element.\n4. After the loop, add the last temporary list to the result.\n\nThis is a linear time algorithm (O(n)), where n is the length of the input list.\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1.

For small to moderate sizes of input, sorting is straightforward and efficient. However, for very large datasets, using a heap (like `heapq.nsmallest`) is more efficient as it avoids the full sort and only keeps track of the k smallest elements.\n\nThe `heapq.nsmallest(k, iterable)` function is particularly useful here. It returns the k smallest elements from the given iterable, which in this case is a list of tuples.

We can find the length of the list, adjust `k` to be within the list length, and then perform the rotation by reordering the nodes.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\nclass ListNode:\n    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):\n        self.val = val\n        self.next = next\n\ndef rotateRight(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:\n    if not head or not head.next or k == 0:\n        return head\n\n    # Find length of the list\n    length = 1\n    current = head\n    while current.next:\n        length += 1\n        current = current.next\n\n    # Adjust k\n    k = k % length\n    if k == 0:\n        return head\n\n    # Find the new head\n    new_head = head\n    for _ in range(length - k - 1):\n        new_head = new_head.next\n\n    # Split the list\n    result = new_head.next\n    new_head.next = None\n\n    # Find the end of the new list and connect to original head\n    current = result\n    while current.next:\n        current = current.next\n    current.next = head\n\n    return result\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Right Rotate a String (GeeksforGeeks)**\n**Problem Description:**\nGiven a string and a number `k`, rotate the string to the right by `k` positions.\n\n**Solution:**\nSimilar to list rotation, we can use slicing. For example, `'abcdef'` rotated by 2 becomes `'efabcd'`.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n```python\ndef right_rotate_string(s: str, k: int) -> str:\n    k = k % len(s)\n    return s[-k:] + s[:-k]\n```\n\n---\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\nThe function `rotate_right` takes a list and an integer `m`, and returns a new list that is the original list rotated to the right by `m` positions. We use Python slicing to get the last `m` elements and the rest of the elements, then concatenate them.\n\n### Python3 code to solve the problem:\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef rotate_right(list: List[int], m: int) -> List[int]:\n    \"\"\"\n    Write a function to rotate a given list by specified number of items to the right direction.\n    \"\"\"\n    n = len(list)\n    m = m % n  # Handle cases where m is larger than the list length\n    return list[-m:] + list[:-m]\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [233], "completion_tokens": [1066], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "task_id": "mbpp_743_rotate_right"}

The Bell number can be computed using a **Bell Triangle**, which is built using the following recurrence relation:\n\n```\nB(0) = 1\nB(n) = sum of the previous row in the Bell triangle\n```\n\nAlternatively, the Bell triangle can be built using the recurrence:\n\n```\nbell[0][0] = 1\nbell[i][0] = bell[i-1][i-1]\nbell[i][j] = bell[i][j-1] + bell[i-1][j-1]\n```\n\nThis is a standard approach for computing Bell numbers efficiently using dynamic programming.\n\n---\n\n## Tutorial:\n\n### What is a Bell Number?\n\nA Bell number, B(n), is the number of ways to partition a set of n elements. For example:\n\n- B(0) = 1 (There's 1 way to partition an empty set)\n- B(1) = 1 (Only one way to partition a single-element set)\n- B(2) = 2 (Two ways: {1}, {2} or {1,2})\n- B(3) = 5\n\n### Bell Triangle:\n\nThe Bell triangle is a way to compute Bell numbers. The triangle is constructed as follows:\n\n- The first row has one element: `1`\n- The second row has two elements: `1`, `2`\n- The third row has three elements: `2`, `3`, `5`\n- The fourth row has four elements: `5`, `7`, `10`, `15`\n- And so on...\n\nEach row starts with the last element of the previous row. Each subsequent element is the sum of the previous element in the same row and the element from the previous row at the same position.\n\nFor example:\n- Row 1: [1]\n- Row 2: [1, 2] (1 is the last element of previous row, 1+1=2)\n- Row 3: [2, 3, 5] (2 is the last element of previous row, 2+1=3, 3+2=5)\n- Row 4: [5, 7, 10, 15] (5 is the last element of previous row, 5+2=7, 7+3=10, 10+5=15)\n\nThe Bell number B(n) is the first element of the nth row.\n\n---\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### 1. **LeetCode 1915. Number of Ways to Split a String into Substrings**\n\n**Problem Description:**  \nGiven a string, count the number of ways to split the string into non-empty substrings such that no two substrings have the same character.\n\n**Solution:**  \nThis is not directly a Bell number problem, but the concept of partitioning and counting ways to split is similar. Bell numbers can be used to count the number of ways to partition a set of elements, which is a similar idea.\n\n**Python3 Code:**\n\n```python\ndef numberOfWays(s: str) -> int:\n    MOD = 10**9 + 7\n    n = len(s)\n    count = [0] * 26\n    for ch in s:\n        count[ord(ch) - ord('a')] += 1\n    res = 0\n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(i + 1, n):\n            if s[i] != s[j]:\n                res += 1\n    return res % MOD\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Codeforces 1095F.

To apply Kadane’s algorithm, we can treat 0s as +1 and 1s as -1, and then find the maximum subarray sum, which will give us the maximum difference between 0s and 1s.\n\n## Tutorial:\nKadane's Algorithm is a dynamic programming approach used to find the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a list of integers. The algorithm works by iterating through the array and keeping track of the maximum sum ending at each position. The idea is to maintain a running sum (`current_max`) and update it as we go. If the current sum becomes negative, we reset it to zero, as a negative sum would not help in finding the maximum subarray sum.\n\nIn this problem, we convert the binary string into a list of values where '0' is treated as +1 and '1' as -1.

The core concepts include **recursion**, **dynamic programming**, and **iterative computation**. The Lucas sequence is defined as:\n- L(0) = 2\n- L(1) = 1\n- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n ≥ 2\n\nThis is a classic example of a **linear recurrence relation**, and the solution can be implemented using **iterative** or **recursive** methods with memoization.\n\n## Tutorial:\nThe Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values. The sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous ones.\n\n### Key Concepts:\n- **Recursive Approach**: Directly implement the recurrence relation. However, this approach has exponential time complexity and is not efficient for large n.\n- **Iterative Approach**: Use a loop to compute the Lucas numbers up to n. This is efficient and runs in O(n) time.\n- **Dynamic Programming (Memoization)**: Store previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations.
