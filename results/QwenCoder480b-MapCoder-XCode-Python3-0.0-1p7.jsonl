{"description": "Iahub is training for the IOI. What is a better way to train than playing a Zuma-like game? There are n balls put in a row. Each ball is colored in one of k colors. Initially the row doesn't contain three or more contiguous balls with the same color. Iahub has a single ball of color x. He can insert his ball at any position in the row (probably, between two other balls). If at any moment there are three or more contiguous balls of the same color in the row, they are destroyed immediately. This rule is applied multiple times, until there are no more sets of 3 or more contiguous balls of the same color. For example, if Iahub has the row of balls [black, black, white, white, black, black] and a white ball, he can insert the ball between two white balls. Thus three white balls are destroyed, and then four black balls become contiguous, so all four balls are destroyed. The row will not contain any ball in the end, so Iahub can destroy all 6 balls.Iahub wants to destroy as many balls as possible. You are given the description of the row of balls, and the color of Iahub's ball.

He wants to buy some number of items (or probably not to buy anything at all) on one of the planets, and then sell the bought items on another planet.

To carry out his plan, Qwerty is going to take a bank loan that covers all expenses and to return the loaned money at the end of the operation (the money is returned without the interest). At the same time, Querty wants to get as much profit as possible.The system has n planets in total. On each of them Qwerty can buy or sell items of m types (such as food, medicine, weapons, alcohol, and so on). For each planet i and each type of items j Qwerty knows the following: aij \u2014 the cost of buying an item;  bij \u2014 the cost of selling an item;  cij \u2014 the number of remaining items.It is not allowed to buy more than cij items of type j on planet i, but it is allowed to sell any number of items of any kind.Knowing that the hold of Qwerty's ship has room for no more than k items, determine the maximum profit which Qwerty can get.", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "2 seconds", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200910, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009m,\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the number of planets, the number of question types and the capacity of Qwerty's ship hold, correspondingly.
