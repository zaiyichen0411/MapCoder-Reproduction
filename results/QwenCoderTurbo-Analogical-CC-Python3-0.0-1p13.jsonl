{"name": "1575_M. Managing Telephone Poles", "description": "Mr. Chanek's city can be represented as a plane. He wants to build a housing complex in the city.\n\nThere are some telephone poles on the plane, which is represented by a grid a of size (n + 1) \u00d7 (m + 1). There is a telephone pole at (x, y) if a_{x, y} = 1.\n\nFor each point (x, y), define S(x, y) as the square of the Euclidean distance between the nearest pole and (x, y). Formally, the square of the Euclidean distance between two points (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) is (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2.\n\nTo optimize the building plan, the project supervisor asks you the sum of all S(x, y) for each 0 \u2264 x \u2264 n and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 m. Help him by finding the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (0 \u2264 n, m < 2000) \u2014 the size of the grid.\n\nThen (n + 1) lines follow, each containing (m + 1) integers a_{i, j} (0 \u2264 a_{i, j} \u2264 1) \u2014 the grid denoting the positions of telephone poles in the plane. There is at least one telephone pole in the given grid.\n\nOutput\n\nOutput an integer denoting the value of \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}}.\n\nExamples\n\nInput\n\n\n2 2\n101\n000\n000\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n18\n\n\nInput\n\n\n5 4\n10010\n00000\n01000\n00001\n00100\n00010\n\n\nOutput\n\n\n36\n\nNote\n\n<image>\n\nIn the first example, the nearest telephone pole for the points (0,0), (1,0), (2,0), (0,1), (1,1), and (2,1) is at (0, 0). While the nearest telephone pole for the points (0, 2), (1,2), and (2,2) is at (0, 2). Thus, \u2211_{x=0}^{n} {\u2211_{y=0}^{m} {S(x, y)}} = (0 + 1 + 4) + (1 + 2 + 5) + (0 + 1 + 4) = 18.", "tags": ["data structures", "geometry"], "difficulty": 20, "id": 1575, "sample_io": [{"input": "2

squared Euclidean distance** from each point in a grid to the nearest \"pole\" (represented by 1s in the grid). This is a classic **multi-source BFS** or **distance transform** problem. The core concepts are:\n\n- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: To propagate the minimum distances from all poles simultaneously.\n- **Priority Queue (Heap)**: To efficiently find the nearest pole for each point (though BFS is sufficient for this problem since the grid is uniform and all poles are sources).\n- **Distance Transform**: A technique used in image processing to compute the distance from each pixel to the nearest object.\n\n## Tutorial:\n\nThe problem can be solved efficiently using **multi-source BFS**. Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Initialization**: All the positions with a pole (value 1) are added to a queue. These are the starting points of the BFS.\n2. **BFS Propagation**: From each pole, we propagate the minimum distance to neighboring cells. For each cell, we store the minimum distance to the nearest pole.\n3. **Distance Calculation**: The distance from a point (x, y) to a pole at (x0, y0) is (x - x0)^2 + (y - y0)^2. We compute this for all poles and take the minimum.\n4. **Summation**: Finally, we sum all the squared distances for all points in the grid.\n\nThis approach ensures that we process each cell only once, and the time complexity is O(n * m), which is acceptable given the constraints (n, m < 2000).\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: **Minimum Distance to a Character in a Grid (LeetCode 1762)**\n\n**Problem Description**: Given a grid of size n x m, where each cell is either '0' or '1', find the minimum distance from each '0' to the nearest '1'.\n\n**Solution**: Use multi-source BFS. Initialize the queue with all '1's. Then perform BFS to compute the minimum distance from each '0' to the nearest '1'.\n\n**Python Code:**\n```python\nfrom collections import deque\n\ndef minDistance(grid):\n    n, m = len(grid), len(grid[0])\n    dist = [[float('inf')] * m for _ in range(n)]\n    q = deque()\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        for j in range(m):\n            if grid[i][j] == '1':\n                dist[i][j] = 0\n                q.append((i, j))\n    \n    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]\n    \n    while q:\n        x, y = q.popleft()\n        for dx, dy in directions:\n            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy\n            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < m and dist[nx][ny] == float('inf'):\n                dist[nx][ny] = dist[x][y] + 1\n                q.append((nx, ny))\n    \n    return dist\n```\n\n---\n\n### Problem 2: **Minimum Distance to a Point (Codeforces 1433C)**\n\n**Problem Description**: Given a grid with some points, compute the minimum distance from each cell to the nearest point.\n\n**Solution**: Use multi-source BFS. Initialize the queue with all the points.
