{"name": "2159", "description": "Polycarp is making a quest for his friends. He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 T, 1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 1000) each \u2014 the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests. The blue circles represent the questions, the two arrows that go from every circle represent where a person goes depending on his answer to that question. The tasks are the red ovals.

The key is that the time taken to reach any task (i.e., the depth of the leaf in the tree) must not exceed `T` minutes. Each task can be used only once.\n\n### Strategy:\nWe can model this as a **knapsack-like** problem where:\n- Each task has a \"cost\" (time `t_i`) and a \"value\" (interest `q_i`)\n- We want to select a subset of tasks such that their **total time** (depth) is at most `T`, and the total interest is maximized.\n\nBut since the tasks are placed in a binary tree, the **maximum depth** of any leaf in the tree is the **time** it takes to reach that task.\n\nSo, the problem reduces to:\n- Select a subset of tasks such that the **maximum time** among them is at most `T`, and the **sum of their interests** is maximized.\n\n### Key Insight:\nWe can sort the tasks by their time `t_i`, and for each possible depth `d` (from 1 to T), we can select the best `d` tasks (with the highest interest) that have time `<= d`.\n\nThis is similar to a **0-1 knapsack** problem, but with a twist: we are not filling a capacity, but instead choosing tasks such that no task has a time greater than `T`.\n\n### Dynamic Programming Approach:\nWe can use a dynamic programming table `dp[d]` where `dp[d]` is the maximum interest value we can get using tasks with time at most `d`.\n\nWe process each task and update the `dp` table from `T` down to `t_i` to avoid reusing the same task multiple times.\n\n### Code:\n```python\n# Read input\nn, T = map(int, input().split())\ntasks = [tuple(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]\n\n# Sort tasks by time\ntasks.sort()\n\n# Initialize DP array\ndp = [0] * (T + 1)\n\nfor t, q in tasks:\n    # Update dp in reverse to avoid using the same task multiple times\n    for d in range(T, t - 1, -1):\n        dp[d] = max(dp[d], dp[d - t] + q)\n\n# The answer is the maximum value in dp[1..T]\nprint(max(dp[1:T+1]))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [828], "completion_tokens": [531], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2159}
