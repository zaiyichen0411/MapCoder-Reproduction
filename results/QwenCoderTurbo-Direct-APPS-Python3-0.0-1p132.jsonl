{"name": "2066", "description": "In the official contest this problem has a different statement, for which jury's solution was working incorrectly, and for this reason it was excluded from the contest. This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha. They continue to make moves until there are only two possible positions remaining (thus, the total number of moves will be n - 2). After that Vova's character takes the position with the lesser coordinate and Lesha's character takes the position with the bigger coordinate and the guys start fighting.\n\nVova and Lesha are already tired by the game of choosing positions, as they need to play it before every fight, so they asked you (the developer of the The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink) to write a module that would automatically determine the distance at which the warrior and the archer will start fighting if both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line on the input contains a single integer n (2 \u2264 n \u2264 200 000, n is even)\u00a0\u2014 the number of positions available initially. The second line contains n distinct integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 \u2264 x_{i} \u2264 10^9), giving the coordinates of the corresponding positions.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the distance between the warrior and the archer at the beginning of the fight, provided that both Vova and Lesha play optimally.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n6\n0 1 3 7 15 31\n\nOutput\n7\n\nInput\n2\n73 37\n\nOutput\n36\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample one of the optimum behavior of the players looks like that:  Vova bans the position at coordinate 15;  Lesha bans the position at coordinate 3;  Vova bans the position at coordinate 31;  Lesha bans the position at coordinate 1. \n\nAfter these actions only positions 0 and 7 will remain, and the distance between them is equal to 7.\n\nIn the second sample there are only two possible positions, so there will be no bans.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2066, "sample_io": [{"input": "6\n0 1 3 7 15 31\n", "output": ["7\n"]}, {"input": "2\n73 37\n", "output": ["36\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "6\n0 1 3 7 15 31\n", "output": ["7\n"]}, {"input": "2\n73 37\n", "output": ["36\n"]}, {"input": "2\n0 1000000000\n", "output": ["1000000000\n"]}, {"input": "8\n729541013 135019377 88372488 319157478 682081360 558614617 258129110 790518782\n", "output": ["470242129\n"]}, {"input": "2\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "8\n552283832 997699491 89302459 301640204 288141798 31112026 710831619 862166501\n", "output": ["521171806\n"]}, {"input": "4\n0 500000000 500000001 1000000000\n", "output": ["500000000\n"]}, {"input": "18\n515925896 832652240 279975694 570998878 28122427 209724246 898414431 709461320 358922485 439508829 403574907 358500312 596248410 968234748 187793884 728450713 30350176 528924900\n", "output": ["369950401\n"]}, {"input": "20\n713900269 192811911 592111899 609607891 585084800 601258511 223103775 876894656 751583891 230837577 971499807 312977833 344314550 397998873 558637732 216574673 913028292 762852863 464376621 61315042\n", "output": ["384683838\n"]}, {"input": "10\n805513144 38998401 16228409 266085559 293487744 471510400 138613792 649258082 904651590 244678415\n", "output": ["277259335\n"]}, {"input": "6\n0 166666666 333333333 499999998 666666665 833333330\n", "output": ["499999997\n"]}, {"input": "16\n1 62500001 125000001 187500000 250000000 312500000 375000000 437500001 500000000 562500000 625000000 687500001 750000001 812500002 875000002 937500000\n", "output": ["499999999\n"]}, {"input": "12\n5 83333336 166666669 250000001 333333336 416666670 500000004 583333336 666666667 750000001 833333334 916666671\n", "output": ["499999998\n"]}, {"input": "20\n54 50000046 100000041 150000049 200000061 250000039 300000043 350000054 400000042 450000045 500000076 550000052 600000064 650000065 700000055 750000046 800000044 850000042 900000052 950000054\n", "output": ["499999988\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\npositions = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the positions\npositions.sort()\n\n# Calculate the minimum possible distance after optimal play\nmin_distance = float('inf')\nfor i in range(n // 2):\n    distance = positions[i + n // 2] - positions[i]\n    if distance < min_distance:\n        min_distance = distance\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_distance)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to simulate the optimal play of Vova and Lesha in banning positions. Here's the key insight:\n\n- Vova and Lesha take turns banning positions, with Vova going first.\n- After `n - 2` bans, two positions remain.\n- Vova wants the final distance between the two positions to be **as small as possible**.\n- Lesha wants the final distance to be **as large as possible**.\n\n### Optimal Strategy:\n\nSince both players play optimally, we can reduce the problem to finding the **minimum possible distance** between any pair of positions that can be left at the end, **given that Vova and Lesha are trying to influence this outcome**.\n\nThe key observation is:\n\n- After sorting the positions, the optimal final pair of positions will be among the **middle** positions.\n- Since both players are trying to influence the final distance, the **best strategy** for both is to **eliminate the outermost positions** (i.e., the smallest and largest), which minimizes the number of possible large distances.\n\nSo, the **optimal final distance** is the **minimum of the differences between the i-th and (n/2 + i)-th positions** in the sorted list, for `i` from 0 to `n/2 - 1`.\n\n### Why this works:\n- By eliminating the outermost positions, the game ends up with a pair of positions that are as close as possible (for Vova) or as far as possible (for Lesha).\n- The optimal play results in the final two positions being in the middle of the sorted list.\n\n### Code:\n\n```python\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\npositions = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Sort the positions\npositions.sort()\n\n# Calculate the minimum possible distance after optimal play\nmin_distance = float('inf')\nfor i in range(n // 2):\n    distance = positions[i + n // 2] - positions[i]\n    if distance < min_distance:\n        min_distance = distance\n\n# Output the result\nprint(min_distance)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [783], "completion_tokens": [434], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2066}
