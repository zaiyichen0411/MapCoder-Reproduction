{"name": "2104", "description": "Pavel made a photo of his favourite stars in the sky. His camera takes a photo of all points of the sky that belong to some rectangle with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.\n\nStrictly speaking, it makes a photo of all points with coordinates $(x, y)$, such that $x_1 \\leq x \\leq x_2$ and $y_1 \\leq y \\leq y_2$, where $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ are coordinates of the left bottom and the right top corners of the rectangle being photographed. The area of this rectangle can be zero.\n\nAfter taking the photo, Pavel wrote down coordinates of $n$ of his favourite stars which appeared in the photo. These points are not necessarily distinct, there can be multiple stars in the same point of the sky.\n\nPavel has lost his camera recently and wants to buy a similar one. Specifically, he wants to know the dimensions of the photo he took earlier. Unfortunately, the photo is also lost. His notes are also of not much help; numbers are written in random order all over his notepad, so it's impossible to tell which numbers specify coordinates of which points.\n\nPavel asked you to help him to determine what are the possible dimensions of the photo according to his notes. As there are multiple possible answers, find the dimensions with the minimal possible area of the rectangle.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains an only integer $n$ ($1 \\leq n \\leq 100\\,000$), the number of points in Pavel's records.\n\nThe second line contains $2 \\cdot n$ integers $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_{2 \\cdot n}$ ($1 \\leq a_i \\leq 10^9$), coordinates, written by Pavel in some order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint the only integer, the minimal area of the rectangle which could have contained all points from Pavel's records.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4\n4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3\n\nOutput\n1\nInput\n3\n5 8 5 5 7 5\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample stars in Pavel's records can be $(1, 3)$, $(1, 3)$, $(2, 3)$, $(2, 4)$. In this case, the minimal area of the rectangle, which contains all these points is $1$ (rectangle with corners at $(1, 3)$ and $(2, 4)$).", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2104, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3\n", "output": ["1"]}, {"input": "3\n5 8 5 5 7 5\n", "output": ["0"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4\n4 1 3 2 3 2 1 3\n", "output": ["1"]}, {"input": "3\n5 8 5 5 7 5\n", "output": ["0"]}, {"input": "1\n553296794 23577639\n", "output": ["0"]}, {"input": "2\n100000001 95312501 97600001 1\n", "output": ["228750000000000"]}, {"input": "2\n1 499999999 705032704 1000000000\n", "output": ["147483647410065408"]}, {"input": "2\n81475384 79354071 83089784 94987161\n", "output": ["25238060496000"]}, {"input": "2\n229872385 40870434 490042790 160550871\n", "output": ["31137307764866984"]}, {"input": "2\n186213023 151398020 526707498 169652181\n", "output": ["6215440966260475"]}, {"input": "2\n95988141 53257147 119443802 199984654\n", "output": ["3441590663566888"]}, {"input": "1\n1 1\n", "output": ["0"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000000 1000000000\n", "output": ["0"]}, {"input": "4\n4 1 3 2 3 11 1 3\n", "output": ["10"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\ndef minimal_rectangle_area():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    coords = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    coords.sort()\n    \n    # Split the sorted list into x and y coordinates\n    x_coords = coords[:n]\n    y_coords = coords[n:]\n    \n    # Calculate the minimal area\n    min_x, max_x = x_coords[0], x_coords[-1]\n    min_y, max_y = y_coords[0], y_coords[-1]\n    \n    area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)\n    print(area)\n\nminimal_rectangle_area()\n\n\n"], "responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to determine the **smallest possible area** of a rectangle that could have contained all the points from Pavel's notes, given that the coordinates are all mixed up.\n\n### Key Observations:\n\n- Each point has an `x` and a `y` coordinate.\n- The input is a list of `2 * n` integers, which are the coordinates of `n` points, but in a random order.\n- We need to find the **minimum area** of a rectangle that could contain all these points.\n\n### Strategy:\n\n1. **Sort the list of coordinates**.\n2. The smallest possible rectangle must have:\n   - Minimum x-coordinate and maximum x-coordinate (for width)\n   - Minimum y-coordinate and maximum y-coordinate (for height)\n3. The **area** is then `(max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)`\n\nBut since the coordinates are mixed, we need to **split the sorted list into two parts**: one for x-coordinates and one for y-coordinates.\n\n### Optimal Split:\n\n- For the minimal area, we want to **minimize the product** of (max_x - min_x) and (max_y - min_y).\n- The best way to do this is to split the sorted list into two equal parts:\n  - First `n` elements as x-coordinates\n  - Last `n` elements as y-coordinates\n\nThis is because:\n- The smallest difference between max and min is achieved when we split the sorted list into two equal parts.\n\n### Python Code:\n\n```python\n# Read input\nimport sys\n\ndef minimal_rectangle_area():\n    n = int(sys.stdin.readline())\n    coords = list(map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split()))\n    coords.sort()\n    \n    # Split the sorted list into x and y coordinates\n    x_coords = coords[:n]\n    y_coords = coords[n:]\n    \n    # Calculate the minimal area\n    min_x, max_x = x_coords[0], x_coords[-1]\n    min_y, max_y = y_coords[0], y_coords[-1]\n    \n    area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)\n    print(area)\n\nminimal_rectangle_area()\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [662], "completion_tokens": [458], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2104}
