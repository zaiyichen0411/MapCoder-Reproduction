{"name": "2000", "description": "Codefortia is a small island country located somewhere in the West Pacific. It consists of $n$ settlements connected by $m$ bidirectional gravel roads. Curiously enough, the beliefs of the inhabitants require the time needed to pass each road to be equal either to $a$ or $b$ seconds. It's guaranteed that one can go between any pair of settlements by following a sequence of roads.\n\nCodefortia was recently struck by the financial crisis. Therefore, the king decided to abandon some of the roads so that:\n\n  it will be possible to travel between each pair of cities using the remaining roads only,  the sum of times required to pass each remaining road will be minimum possible (in other words, remaining roads must form minimum spanning tree, using the time to pass the road as its weight),  among all the plans minimizing the sum of times above, the time required to travel between the king's residence (in settlement $1$) and the parliament house (in settlement $p$) using the remaining roads only will be minimum possible. \n\nThe king, however, forgot where the parliament house was. For each settlement $p = 1, 2, \\dots, n$, can you tell what is the minimum time required to travel between the king's residence and the parliament house (located in settlement $p$) after some roads are abandoned?\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains four integers $n$, $m$, $a$ and $b$ ($2 \\leq n \\leq 70$, $n - 1 \\leq m \\leq 200$, $1 \\leq a < b \\leq 10^7$) \u2014 the number of settlements and gravel roads in Codefortia, and two possible travel times. Each of the following lines contains three integers $u, v, c$ ($1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$, $u \\neq v$, $c \\in \\{a, b\\}$) denoting a single gravel road between the settlements $u$ and $v$, which requires $c$ minutes to travel.\n\nYou can assume that the road network is connected and has no loops or multiedges.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nOutput a single line containing $n$ integers. The $p$-th of them should denote the minimum possible time required to travel from $1$ to $p$ after the selected roads are abandoned. Note that for each $p$ you can abandon a different set of roads.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5 20 25\n1 2 25\n2 3 25\n3 4 20\n4 5 20\n5 1 20\n\nOutput\n0 25 60 40 20\n\nInput\n6 7 13 22\n1 2 13\n2 3 13\n1 4 22\n3 4 13\n4 5 13\n5 6 13\n6 1 13\n\nOutput\n0 13 26 39 26 13\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nThe minimum possible sum of times required to pass each road in the first example is $85$ \u2014 exactly one of the roads with passing time $25$ must be abandoned. Note that after one of these roads is abandoned, it's now impossible to travel between settlements $1$ and $3$ in time $50$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2000, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 5 20 25\n1 2 25\n2 3 25\n3 4 20\n4 5 20\n5 1 20\n", "output": ["0 25 60 40 20\n"]}, {"input": "6 7 13 22\n1 2 13\n2 3 13\n1 4 22\n3 4 13\n4 5 13\n5 6 13\n6 1 13\n", "output": ["0 13 26 39 26 13\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "5 5 20 25\n1 2 25\n2 3 25\n3 4 20\n4 5 20\n5 1 20\n", "output": ["0 25 60 40 20\n"]}, {"input": "6 7 13 22\n1 2 13\n2 3 13\n1 4 22\n3 4 13\n4 5 13\n5 6 13\n6 1 13\n", "output": ["0 13 26 39 26 13\n"]}, {"input": "2 1 1 2\n2 1 1\n", "output": ["0 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 1 9999999 10000000\n1 2 10000000\n", "output": ["0 10000000\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 78422 6789101\n3 1 6789101\n2 1 78422\n2 3 78422\n", "output": ["0 78422 156844\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 2770628 3912422\n1 2 2770628\n2 3 2770628\n1 3 3912422\n", "output": ["0 2770628 5541256\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 2566490 5132980\n1 2 2566490\n2 3 2566490\n3 1 5132980\n", "output": ["0 2566490 5132980\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 509529 5982470\n1 2 509529\n3 2 509529\n", "output": ["0 509529 1019058\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 1349740 8457492\n2 1 1349740\n3 1 1349740\n", "output": ["0 1349740 1349740\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 150319 5002968\n3 2 150319\n1 2 5002968\n", "output": ["0 5002968 5153287\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 990530 8623767\n3 2 8623767\n1 2 990530\n", "output": ["0 990530 9614297\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 810925 2022506\n1 2 2022506\n1 3 810925\n", "output": ["0 2022506 810925\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 1651136 5131013\n1 2 5131013\n3 2 5131013\n", "output": ["0 5131013 10262026\n"]}, {"input": "3 2 451715 1577270\n1 3 1577270\n1 2 1577270\n", "output": ["0 1577270 1577270\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 1291926 4943478\n2 3 1291926\n1 2 1291926\n3 1 1291926\n", "output": ["0 1291926 1291926\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 2132137 9084127\n1 2 2132137\n3 2 9084127\n3 1 2132137\n", "output": ["0 2132137 2132137\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 1126640 9858678\n3 1 9858678\n3 2 1126640\n1 2 9858678\n", "output": ["0 9858678 9858678\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 1966851 6439891\n1 3 6439891\n1 2 1966851\n3 2 6439891\n", "output": ["0 1966851 6439891\n"]}, {"input": "3 3 1787246 7806211\n3 2 7806211\n2 1 7806211\n1 3 7806211\n", "output": ["0 7806211 7806211\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["\nimport sys\nimport threading\n\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    data = input().split()\n    \n    idx = 0\n    n = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n    m = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n    a = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n    b = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n\n    edges = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        u = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n        v = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n        c = int(data[idx]); idx += 1\n        edges.append((u, v, c))\n\n    # Step 1: Build MST\n    # We will use Kruskal's algorithm, prioritizing a over b\n    parent = list(range(n + 1))\n\n    def find(u):\n        while parent[u] != u:\n            parent[u] = parent[parent[u]]\n            u = parent[u]\n        return u\n\n    def union(u, v):\n        pu = find(u)\n        pv = find(v)\n        if pu == pv:\n            return False\n        parent[pu] = pv\n        return True\n\n    # Sort edges: first by weight (a < b), then by u and v\n    edges.sort(key=lambda x: (x[2], x[0], x[1]))\n\n    mst_edges = []\n    for u, v, c in edges:\n        if union(u, v):\n            mst_edges.append((u, v, c))\n\n    # Step 2: Build adjacency list of MST\n    from collections import defaultdict\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    for u, v, c in mst_edges:\n        graph[u].append((v, c))\n        graph[v].append((u, c))\n\n    # Step 3: BFS or Dijkstra to find shortest path from node 1 to all others\n    import heapq\n    dist = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)\n    dist[1] = 0\n    heap = [(0, 1)]\n\n    while heap:\n        d, u = heapq.heappop(heap)\n        if d > dist[u]:\n            continue\n        for v, w in graph[u]:\n            if dist[v] > dist[u] + w:\n                dist[v] = dist[u] + w\n                heapq.heappush(heap, (dist[v], v))\n\n    result = [str(dist[i]) for i in range(1, n + 1)]\n    print(' '.join(result))\n\n# To prevent stack overflow in some environments\nthreading.Thread(target=main).start()\n\n\n"], "responses": ["To solve this problem, we need to find the **minimum spanning tree (MST)** of the graph where each edge has a weight of either `a` or `b`.
