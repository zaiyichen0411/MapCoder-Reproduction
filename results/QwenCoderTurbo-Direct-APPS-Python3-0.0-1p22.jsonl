{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    # Split the input string into individual frames\n    frame_list = frames.split()\n    \n    total_score = 0\n    roll_index = 0\n    \n    # Convert frames to a list of rolls for easier processing\n    rolls = []\n    for frame in frame_list:\n        for char in frame:\n            if char == 'X':\n                rolls.append(10)\n            elif char == '/':\n                rolls.append(10 - rolls[-1] if rolls else 10)\n            else:\n                rolls.append(int(char))\n    \n    frame_index = 0\n    for i in range(10):  # 10 frames\n        if i < 9:  # First 9 frames\n            if rolls[frame_index] == 10:  # Strike\n                # Score is 10 + next two rolls\n                total_score += 10 + rolls[frame_index + 1] + rolls[frame_index + 2]\n                frame_index += 1\n            elif rolls[frame_index] + rolls[frame_index + 1] == 10:  # Spare\n                # Score is 10 + next roll\n                total_score += 10 + rolls[frame_index + 2]\n                frame_index += 2\n            else:  # Open frame\n                total_score += rolls[frame_index] + rolls[frame_index + 1]\n                frame_index += 2\n        else:  # 10th frame\n            # For the 10th frame, just add all the rolls\n            while frame_index < len(rolls):\n                total_score += rolls[frame_index]\n                frame_index += 1\n    \n    return total_score\n\n# Read input and call function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    frames_input = input().strip()\n    result = bowlingScore(frames_input)\n    print(result)\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef bowlingScore(frames):\n    # Split the input string into individual frames\n    frame_list = frames.split()\n    \n    total_score = 0\n    roll_index = 0\n    \n    # Convert frames to a list of rolls for easier processing\n    rolls = []\n    for frame in frame_list:\n        for char in frame:\n            if char == 'X':\n                rolls.append(10)\n            elif char == '/':\n                rolls.append(10 - rolls[-1] if rolls else 10)\n            else:\n                rolls.append(int(char))\n    \n    frame_index = 0\n    for i in range(10):  # 10 frames\n        if i < 9:  # First 9 frames\n            if rolls[frame_index] == 10:  # Strike\n                # Score is 10 + next two rolls\n                total_score += 10 + rolls[frame_index + 1] + rolls[frame_index + 2]\n                frame_index += 1\n            elif rolls[frame_index] + rolls[frame_index + 1] == 10:  # Spare\n                # Score is 10 + next roll\n                total_score += 10 + rolls[frame_index + 2]\n                frame_index += 2\n            else:  # Open frame\n                total_score += rolls[frame_index] + rolls[frame_index + 1]\n                frame_index += 2\n        else:  # 10th frame\n            # For the 10th frame, just add all the rolls\n            while frame_index < len(rolls):\n                total_score += rolls[frame_index]\n                frame_index += 1\n    \n    return total_score\n\n# Read input and call function\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    frames_input = input().strip()\n    result = bowlingScore(frames_input)\n    print(result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [910], "completion_tokens": [392], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1622}

It uses `Counter` from the `collections` module to count occurrences of each lowercase letter in both strings.\n2. It considers only lowercase letters by filtering with `str.islower`.\n3. For each letter that appears in either string, it checks if the maximum occurrence is greater than 1.\n4. Based on which string has the higher count (or if they're equal), it assigns the appropriate prefix.\n5. The results are sorted first by the length of the letter sequence (descending) and then lexicographically.\n6. Finally, it replaces `=:` with `E:` for compatibility with certain languages as specified in the problem description."], "prompt_tokens": [956], "completion_tokens": [506], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1640}
