{"name": "1627", "description": "### Background\n\nI was reading a [book](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Things-Make-Do-Fourth-Dimension/dp/1846147646/) recently, \"Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension\" by comedian and mathematician Matt Parker, and in the first chapter of the book Matt talks about problems he likes to solve in his head to take his mind off the fact that he is in his dentist's chair, we've all been there!\n\nThe problem he talks about relates to polydivisible numbers, and I thought a kata should be written on the subject as it's quite interesting. (Well it's interesting to me, so there!)\n\n### Polydivisib... huh what?\n\nSo what are they?\n\nA polydivisible number is divisible in an unusual way. The first digit is cleanly divisible by `1`, the first two digits are cleanly divisible by `2`, the first three by `3` and so on.\n\nThe interesting thing about polydivisiblity is that it relates to the underlying number, but not the base it is written in, so if aliens came to Earth and used base `23` (`11` fingers on one hand and `12` on the other), no matter what squiggles they use to write numbers, they would find the same numbers polydivisible!\n\n### Polydivisibilty Example:\n\nLet's do a worked example to clear up any questions ...\n\nStarting wih the number `1,232` in base `10` then:\n\n```\n 1232\n 1    /1 = 1    Yay!\n 12   /2 = 6    Yay!\n 123  /3 = 41   Yay!\n 1232 /4 = 308  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `1,232` is a polydivisible number in base `4` and above.\n\nHowever starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `10` then:\n\n```\n 123220\n 1      /1 = 1            Yay!\n 12     /2 = 6            Yay!\n 123    /3 = 41           Yay!\n 1232   /4 = 308          Yay!\n 12322  /5 = 2464.4       Oh no, that's not a round number!\n 123220 /6 = 220536.333r  Oh no, that's not a round number!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is not a polydivisible base 10 number, but what about in another base?\n\nAgain starting wih the number `123,220` and using base `6` then:\n\n```\n base 6   base 10\n 1      = 1       -> 1     /1 = 1     Yay!\n 12     = 8       -> 8     /2 = 4     Yay!\n 123    = 51      -> 51    /3 = 17    Yay!\n 1232   = 308     -> 308   /4 = 77    Yay!\n 12322  = 1850    -> 1850  /5 = 370   Yay!\n 123220 = 11100   -> 11100 /6 = 1850  Yay!\n```\n\nThus `123,220` is a polydivisible base `6` number (and a polydivisible base `10` number when converted to `11100` in base `10`).\n\n### Kata\n\nIn this kata you must implement two methods: `is_polydivisible(n, b)` and `get_polydivisible(n, b)`.\n\nThe first `is_polydivisible(n, b)` will return `True` if `n` is polydivisible in base `b` or `False` if not.\n\nThe second `get_polydivisible(n, b)` will return the `n`th polydivisible number using base `b`, the first polydivisible number is of course always `0`.\n\nYou can assume that all inputs are valid.\n\n```if:haskell\nAll necessary arithmetic can be done in `Int` range.\n```\n\n### Kata Examples:\n\n```python\n    is_polydivisible(\"1232\", 10)   # => True\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 10) # => False\n    is_polydivisible(\"123220\", 6)  # => True\n    get_polydivisible(22, 10)      # => \"32\"\n    get_polydivisible(22, 16)      # => \"1A\"\n    get_polydivisible(42, 16)      # => \"42\"\n```\n\n#### A Note on Bases\n\nThe maximum base used is base `62`, and uses characters in the following order `[0-9][A-Z][a-z]` to denote its digits, base `n` will use the first `n` characters of this sequence.\n```if-not:haskell\nA constant CHARS has been declared with this sequence for you.\n```", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1627, "sample_io": [{"input": "1232\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "123220\n6", "output": [true]}], "test_list": [{"input": "123\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "1234\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12345\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "12365\n10", "output": [true]}, {"input": "123220\n10", "output": [false]}, {"input": "50041\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "140410\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "203230\n6", "output": [true]}, {"input": "30043052\n6", "output": [true]}], "starter_code": "\ndef is_polydivisible(s, b):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\n# Define the character set for bases up to 62\nCHARS = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'\n\ndef to_base(n, base):\n    \"\"\"Convert a decimal number to a given base as a string.\"\"\"\n    if n == 0:\n        return '0'\n    digits = []\n    while n > 0:\n        digits.append(CHARS[n % base])\n        n //= base\n    return ''.join(reversed(digits))\n\ndef from_base(s, base):\n    \"\"\"Convert a string in a given base to a decimal integer.\"\"\"\n    result = 0\n    for c in s:\n        result = result * base + CHARS.index(c)\n    return result\n\ndef is_polydivisible(n_str, base):\n    \"\"\"\n    Check if the number represented by n_str in base `base` is polydivisible.\n    \"\"\"\n    num = from_base(n_str, base)\n    for i in range(1, len(n_str) + 1):\n        if num % i != 0:\n            return False\n        num //= 10  #
