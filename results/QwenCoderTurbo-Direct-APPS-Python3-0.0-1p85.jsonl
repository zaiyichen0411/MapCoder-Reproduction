{"name": "1622", "description": "# Ten-Pin Bowling\n\nIn the game of ten-pin bowling, a player rolls a bowling ball down a lane to knock over pins. There are ten pins set at the end of the bowling lane. Each player has 10 frames to roll a bowling ball down a lane and knock over as many pins as possible. The first nine frames are ended after two rolls or when the player knocks down all the pins. The last frame a player will receive an extra roll every time they knock down all ten pins; up to a maximum of three total rolls. \n\n## The Challenge\n\nIn this challenge you will be given a string representing a player's ten frames. It will look something like this: `'X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44'` (in Java: `\"X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44\"`), where each frame is space-delimited, `'X'` represents strikes, and `'/'` represents spares. Your goal is take in this string of frames into a function called `bowlingScore` and return the players total score.\n\n## Scoring\n\nThe scoring for ten-pin bowling can be difficult to understand, and if you're like most people, easily forgotten if you don't play often. Here is a quick breakdown:\n\n### Frames\n\nIn Ten-Pin Bowling there are ten frames per game. Frames are the players turn to bowl, which can be multiple rolls. The first 9 frames you get 2 rolls maximum to try to get all 10 pins down. **On the 10th or last frame a player will receive an extra roll each time they get all ten pins down to a maximum of three total rolls. Also on the last frame bonuses are not awarded for strikes and spares moving forward.**\n\nIn this challenge, three frames might be represented like this: `54 72 44`. In this case, the player has had three frames. On their first frame they scored 9 points (5 + 4), on their second frame they scored 9 points (7 + 2) and on their third frame they scored 8 points (4 + 4). This is a very simple example of bowling scoring. It gets more complicated when we introduce strikes and spares.\n\n### Strikes \nRepresented in this challenge as `'X'`\n\nA strike is scored when a player knocks all ten pins down in one roll. In the first 9 frames this will conclude the players turn and it will be scored as 10 points plus the points received from the next two rolls. So if a player were to have two frames `X 54`, the total score of those two frames would be 28. The first frame would be worth 19 (10 + 5 + 4) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nA perfect game in bowling is 12 strikes in a row and would be represented like this `'X X X X X X X X X XXX'` (in Java: `\"X X X X X X X X X XXX\"`). This adds up to a total score of 300.\n\n### Spares\nRepresented in this challenge as `'/'`\n\nA spare is scored when a player knocks down all ten pins in two rolls. In the first 9 frames this will be scored as 10 points plus the next roll. So if a player were to have two frames `9/ 54`, the total score of the two frames would be 24. The first frame would be worth 15 (10 + 5) and the second frame would be worth 9 (5 + 4).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation see Wikipedia: \n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ten-pin_bowling#Scoring", "difficulty": "interview", "id": 1622, "sample_io": [{"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}], "test_list": [{"input": "11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11", "output": [20]}, {"input": "X X X X X X X X X XXX", "output": [300]}, {"input": "00 5/ 4/ 53 33 22 4/ 5/ 45 XXX", "output": [115]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 8/8", "output": [150]}, {"input": "5/ 4/ 3/ 2/ 1/ 0/ X 9/ 4/ 7/2", "output": [143]}, {"input": "X X 9/ 80 X X 90 8/ 7/ 44", "output": [171]}, {"input": "6/ 5/ 6/ 2/ 3/ 0/ 1/ 8/ 3/ 6/5", "output": [139]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 0/X", "output": [20]}, {"input": "00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 X 0/X", "output": [40]}], "starter_code": "\ndef bowling_score(frames):\n\t", "source_codes": ["\ndef bowlingScore(frames_str):\n    frames = frames_str.split()\n    score = 0\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < len(frames):\n        if frames[i] == 'X':  # Strike\n            score += 10\n            if i + 1 < len(frames):\n                if frames[i + 1] == 'X':  # Strike in next roll\n                    score += 10\n                    if i + 2 < len(frames):\n                        if frames[i + 2] == 'X':\n                            score += 10\n                        else:\n                            score += int(frames[i + 2])\n                else:\n                    score += int(frames[i + 1])\n                    if i + 2 < len(frames):\n                        score += int(frames[i + 2])\n            i += 1\n        elif '/' in frames[i]:  # Spare\n            score += 10\n            if i + 1 < len(frames):\n                score += int(frames[i + 1])\n            i += 1\n        else:  # Regular roll\n            score += int(frames[i]) + (int(frames[i + 1]) if i + 1 < len(frames) else 0)\n            i += 2\n\n    return score\n\n# Read input from standard input\nframes_input = input().strip()\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(bowlingScore(frames_input))\n\n\n"], "responses": ["```python\ndef bowlingScore(frames_str):\n    frames = frames_str.split()\n    score = 0\n    i = 0\n\n    while i < len(frames):\n        if frames[i] == 'X':  # Strike\n            score += 10\n            if i + 1 < len(frames):\n                if frames[i + 1] == 'X':  # Strike in next roll\n                    score += 10\n                    if i + 2 < len(frames):\n                        if frames[i + 2] == 'X':\n                            score += 10\n                        else:\n                            score += int(frames[i + 2])\n                else:\n                    score += int(frames[i + 1])\n                    if i + 2 < len(frames):\n                        score += int(frames[i + 2])\n            i += 1\n        elif '/' in frames[i]:  # Spare\n            score += 10\n            if i + 1 < len(frames):\n                score += int(frames[i + 1])\n            i += 1\n        else:  # Regular roll\n            score += int(frames[i]) + (int(frames[i + 1]) if i + 1 < len(frames) else 0)\n            i += 2\n\n    return score\n\n# Read input from standard input\nframes_input = input().strip()\n# Call the function and print the result\nprint(bowlingScore(frames_input))\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [914], "completion_tokens": [295], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 1622}
