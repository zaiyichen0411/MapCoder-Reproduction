An **odd number** of subsegments\n2. Each subsegment must:\n   - Have **odd length**\n   - **Start and end** with odd numbers\n\n## Key Insights\n\nLet me think about what this means:\n\n1. If we have `k` subsegments where `k` is odd, and each subsegment has odd length, then the total length would be:\n   - Odd \u00d7 Odd = Odd (since sum of odd number of odd terms is odd)\n   \n2. So for a valid division to exist, `n` must be odd (since we need total length to be odd).\n\n3. Now, let's think about the structure. Each subsegment starts and ends with odd numbers, and has odd length.\n\n4. For the entire sequence to be divisible as required:\n   - The first element must be odd (start of first subsegment)\n   - The last element must be odd (end of last subsegment)\n   - We need to be able to partition it appropriately\n\nWait, let me re-read more carefully...\n\nActually, let's think differently. Since each subsegment has odd length and must start and end with odd numbers, and we want an odd number of such subsegments:\n\n- First subsegment: starts with a[0], ends with some a[i] where both are odd\n- Last subsegment: starts with some a[j], ends with a[n-1] where both are odd\n\n## Critical Observation\n\nLet me trace through the examples:\n1. `[1, 3, 5]` \u2192 Yes (1 subsegment of length 3)\n2. `[1, 0, 1, 5, 1]` \u2192 Yes (3 subsegments: [1,0,1], [5], [1])\n3. `[4, 3, 1]` \u2192 No (starts with even number 4)\n4. `[3, 9, 9, 3]` \u2192 No (length 4 is even, so we'd need even number of subsegments)\n\n## Deeper Analysis\n\nHere's the key insight:\n- We need an odd number of subsegments, each with odd length\n- Sum of odd lengths an odd number of times = odd total length\n- So n must be odd\n\nBut also:\n- First element of sequence must be odd (start of first subsegment)  \n- Last element of sequence must be odd (end of last subsegment)\n\nAre these sufficient conditions?\n\nLet me check:\n- Example 1: n=3(odd), first=1(odd), last=5(odd) \u2192 Yes \u2713\n- Example 3: n=3(odd), first=4(even), last=1(odd) \u2192 No \u2713\n- Example 4: n=4(even) \u2192 No \u2713\n\nWhat about example 2?\n- n=5(odd), first=1(odd), last=1(odd) \u2192 Should be Yes \u2713\n\nIs it always possible when n is odd, first is odd, and last is odd?\n\nLet's think... We can always make subsegments of length 1 for odd numbers. But we need an odd number of subsegments.\n\nIf we have at least one odd number at start and one at end, and n is odd, we can try to construct:\n- Make single-element subsegments for all odd numbers\n- Group even numbers with adjacent odd numbers to maintain the constraint\n\nActually, let me think more systematically:\n\nThe key insight is that we want an odd number of subsegments, each starting and ending with odd numbers and having odd length.\n\nA simpler way to think:\n- The first element must be odd (required to start the first subsegment)\n- The last element must be odd (required to end the last subsegment)  \n- The total number of elements n must allow for an odd number of odd-length partitions\n\nBut actually, there's an even simpler characterization!\n\nSince we're making an odd number of subsegments, each of odd length, the total length is odd. So n must be odd.\n\nAnd since the first subsegment must start with an odd number, a[0] must be odd.\nSince the last subsegment must end with an odd number, a[n-1] must be odd.\n\nAre these three conditions sufficient?\n\nLet's see if we can always construct a valid partition when:\n1. n is odd\n2. a[0] is odd  \n3. a[n-1] is odd\n\nConstruction approach:\nWe can make each odd element its own subsegment of length 1 (which is odd). \nThis gives us k subsegments where k = number of odd elements.\n\nBut we need k to be odd.\n\nHmm, let's count odd positions. In an array of odd length, if first and last are odd, what can we say?\n\nActually, let's just try a greedy construction:\n- Start from left\n- Accumulate elements until we can end with an odd number (and ensure odd count so far)  \n- Continue...\n\nEven simpler approach based on the pattern:\n\n**The answer is \"Yes\" if and only if:**\n1. n is odd, AND\n2. a[0] is odd, AND  \n3. a[n-1] is odd\n\nLet me verify:\n1. n=3, a=[1,3,5]: n odd\u2713, a[0]=1 odd\u2713, a[2]=5 odd\u2713 \u2192 Yes \u2713\n2. n=5, a=[1,0,1,5,1]: n odd\u2713, a[0]=1 odd\u2713, a[4]=1 odd\u2713 \u2192 Yes \u2713  \n3. n=3, a=[4,3,1]: n odd\u2713, a[0]=4 even\u2717 \u2192 No \u2713\n4. n=4, a=[3,9,9,3]: n even\u2717 \u2192 No \u2713\n\nPerfect! This matches all examples.\n\n## Solution Approach\n\nCheck three conditions:\n1. Length n is odd\n2. First element is odd  \n3.
