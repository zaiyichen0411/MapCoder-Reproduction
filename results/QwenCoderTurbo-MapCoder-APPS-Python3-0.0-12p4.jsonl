{"name": "2183", "description": "We start with a string $s$ consisting only of the digits $1$, $2$, or $3$. The length of $s$ is denoted by $|s|$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $|s|$, the $i$-th character of $s$ is denoted by $s_i$. \n\nThere is one cursor. The cursor's location $\\ell$ is denoted by an integer in $\\{0, \\ldots, |s|\\}$, with the following meaning:   If $\\ell = 0$, then the cursor is located before the first character of $s$.  If $\\ell = |s|$, then the cursor is located right after the last character of $s$.  If $0 < \\ell < |s|$, then the cursor is located between $s_\\ell$ and $s_{\\ell+1}$. \n\nWe denote by $s_\\text{left}$ the string to the left of the cursor and $s_\\text{right}$ the string to the right of the cursor. \n\nWe also have a string $c$, which we call our clipboard, which starts out as empty. There are three types of actions:  The Move action. Move the cursor one step to the right. This increments $\\ell$ once.  The Cut action. Set $c \\leftarrow s_\\text{right}$, then set $s \\leftarrow s_\\text{left}$.  The Paste action. Append the value of $c$ to the end of the string $s$. Note that this doesn't modify $c$. \n\nThe cursor initially starts at $\\ell = 0$. Then, we perform the following procedure:  Perform the Move action once.  Perform the Cut action once.  Perform the Paste action $s_\\ell$ times.  If $\\ell = x$, stop. Otherwise, return to step 1. \n\nYou're given the initial string $s$ and the integer $x$. What is the length of $s$ when the procedure stops? Since this value may be very large, only find it modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\nIt is guaranteed that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \\le t \\le 1000$) denoting the number of test cases. The next lines contain descriptions of the test cases.\n\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $x$ ($1 \\le x \\le 10^6$). The second line of each test case consists of the initial string $s$ ($1 \\le |s| \\le 500$). It is guaranteed, that $s$ consists of the characters \"1\", \"2\", \"3\".\n\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $x$ in a single file is at most $10^6$. It is guaranteed that in each test case before the procedure will stop it will be true that $\\ell \\le |s|$ at any time.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nFor each test case, output a single line containing a single integer denoting the answer for that test case modulo $10^9 + 7$. \n\n\n-----Example-----\nInput\n4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n\nOutput\n25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nLet's illustrate what happens with the first test case. Initially, we have $s = $ 231. Initially, $\\ell = 0$ and $c = \\varepsilon$ (the empty string). The following things happen if we follow the procedure above:\n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 1$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2 and $c = $ 31.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 2 times: we get $s = $ 23131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 1 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 2$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23 and $c = $ 131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 2 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 3$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 231 and $c = $ 31131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 time: we get $s = $ 23131131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 3 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 4$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 2313 and $c = $ 1131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 3 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 4 \\not= x = 5$, so we return to step 1. \n\n  Step 1, Move once: we get $\\ell = 5$.  Step 2, Cut once: we get $s = $ 23131 and $c = $ 13113111311311131131.  Step 3, Paste $s_\\ell = $ 1 times: we get $s = $ 2313113113111311311131131.  Step 4: $\\ell = 5 = x$, so we stop. \n\nAt the end of the procedure, $s$ has length $25$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2183, "sample_io": [{"input": "4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n", "output": ["25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4\n5\n231\n7\n2323\n6\n333\n24\n133321333\n", "output": ["25\n1438\n1101\n686531475\n"]}, {"input": "9\n1500\n1212\n1500\n1221\n1500\n122\n1500\n12121\n1500\n22\n1500\n1111112111111112\n1500\n1111111111221111111\n1500\n111111122\n1500\n11111121111121111111\n", "output": ["1504\n1599\n1502\n1598\n1502\n1510\n1657\n1502\n1763\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n22\n", "output": ["1000002\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n221\n", "output": ["1001822\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n1221\n", "output": ["1001823\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2121\n", "output": ["1001821\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2211\n", "output": ["1002004\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n1212\n", "output": ["1000004\n"]}, {"input": "1\n1000000\n2112\n", "output": ["1000006\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "responses": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "prompt_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "completion_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "no_of_try": 12, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2183}

{"name": "2047", "description": "Allen dreams of one day owning a enormous fleet of electric cars, the car of the future! He knows that this will give him a big status boost. As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time. Help Allen determine if he should bother parking his cars or leave it to someone less important.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line of the input contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \\le n \\le 50$, $1 \\le k \\le 2n$), representing the number of columns and the number of cars, respectively.\n\nThe next four lines will contain $n$ integers each between $0$ and $k$ inclusive, representing the initial state of the parking lot. The rows are numbered $1$ to $4$ from top to bottom and the columns are numbered $1$ to $n$ from left to right.\n\nIn the first and last line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents a parking spot assigned to car $x$ (you can only move this car to this place), while the integer $0$ represents a empty space (you can't move any car to this place).\n\nIn the second and third line, an integer $1 \\le x \\le k$ represents initial position of car $x$, while the integer $0$ represents an empty space (you can move any car to this place).\n\nEach $x$ between $1$ and $k$ appears exactly once in the second and third line, and exactly once in the first and fourth line.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIf there is a sequence of moves that brings all of the cars to their parking spaces, with at most $20000$ car moves, then print $m$, the number of moves, on the first line. On the following $m$ lines, print the moves (one move per line) in the format $i$ $r$ $c$, which corresponds to Allen moving car $i$ to the neighboring space at row $r$ and column $c$.\n\nIf it is not possible for Allen to move all the cars to the correct spaces with at most $20000$ car moves, print a single line with the integer $-1$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n\nOutput\n6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n\nOutput\n-1\n\nInput\n1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\nOutput\n2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test case, all cars are in front of their spots except car $5$, which is in front of the parking spot adjacent. The example shows the shortest possible sequence of moves, but any sequence of length at most $20000$ will be accepted.\n\nIn the second sample test case, there is only one column, and the cars are in the wrong order, so no cars can move and the task is impossible.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2047, "sample_io": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "4 5\n1 2 0 4\n1 2 0 4\n5 0 0 3\n0 5 0 3\n", "output": ["6\n1 1 1\n2 1 2\n4 1 4\n3 4 4\n5 3 2\n5 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "1 2\n1\n1\n2\n2\n", "output": ["2\n1 1 1\n2 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 2\n1 0\n0 2\n0 1\n0 2\n", "output": ["7\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n2 3 1\n1 2 1\n2 3 2\n1 1 1\n2 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "7 14\n2 11 1 14 9 8 5\n12 6 7 1 10 2 3\n14 13 9 8 5 4 11\n13 6 4 3 12 7 10\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "2 1\n0 0\n0 0\n0 1\n0 1\n", "output": ["1\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "2 3\n0 2\n0 1\n3 2\n3 1\n", "output": ["7\n1 2 1\n2 2 2\n3 4 1\n1 3 1\n2 1 2\n1 3 2\n1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n", "output": ["2\n1 3 1\n1 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "2 4\n3 4\n2 1\n3 4\n2 1\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "3 5\n2 1 5\n5 3 2\n4 0 1\n0 4 3\n", "output": ["18\n4 3 2\n5 3 1\n3 2 1\n2 2 2\n1 2 3\n4 4 2\n5 3 2\n3 3 1\n2 2 1\n1 2 2\n5 3 3\n3 3 2\n2 1 1\n1 1 2\n5 2 3\n3 3 3\n5 1 3\n3 4 3\n"]}, {"input": "10 1\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["1\n1 1 3\n"]}, {"input": "50 1\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["34\n1 3 27\n1 3 28\n1 3 29\n1 3 30\n1 3 31\n1 3 32\n1 3 33\n1 3 34\n1 3 35\n1 3 36\n1 3 37\n1 3 38\n1 3 39\n1 3 40\n1 3 41\n1 3 42\n1 3 43\n1 3 44\n1 3 45\n1 3 46\n1 3 47\n1 3 48\n1 3 49\n1 3 50\n1 2 50\n1 2 49\n1 2 48\n1 2 47\n1 2 46\n1 2 45\n1 2 44\n1 2 43\n1 2 42\n1 1 42\n"]}, {"input": "22 2\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0\n", "output": ["65\n2 2 13\n1 3 21\n2 2 12\n1 3 22\n2 2 11\n1 2 22\n2 2 10\n1 2 21\n2 2 9\n1 2 20\n2 2 8\n1 2 19\n2 2 7\n1 2 18\n2 2 6\n1 2 17\n2 2 5\n1 2 16\n2 2 4\n1 2 15\n2 2 3\n1 2 14\n2 2 2\n1 2 13\n2 2 1\n1 2 12\n2 3 1\n1 2 11\n2 3 2\n1 2 10\n2 3 3\n1 2 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 8\n2 3 5\n1 2 7\n2 3 6\n1 2 6\n2 3 7\n1 2 5\n2 3 8\n1 2 4\n2 3 9\n1 2 3\n2 3 10\n1 2 2\n2 3 11\n1 2 1\n2 3 12\n1 3 1\n2 3 13\n1 3 2\n2 3 14\n1 3 3\n2 3 15\n1 3 4\n2 3 16\n1 3 5\n2 3 17\n1 3 6\n2 3 18\n1 3 7\n2 4 18\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "12 3\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0\n2 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 1 0 0\n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 3 0 2 0\n", "output": ["38\n1 3 11\n3 3 7\n2 3 2\n1 3 12\n3 3 8\n2 3 3\n1 2 12\n3 3 9\n2 3 4\n1 2 11\n3 4 9\n2 3 5\n1 2 10\n2 3 6\n1 2 9\n2 3 7\n1 2 8\n2 3 8\n1 2 7\n2 3 9\n1 2 6\n2 3 10\n1 2 5\n2 3 11\n1 2 4\n2 4 11\n1 2 3\n1 2 2\n1 2 1\n1 3 1\n1 3 2\n1 3 3\n1 3 4\n1 3 5\n1 3 6\n1 3 7\n1 3 8\n1 4 8\n"]}, {"input": "10 20\n18 9 4 5 12 14 16 1 15 20\n11 13 16 6 18 5 20 17 4 3\n12 9 15 14 8 10 2 19 1 7\n6 11 13 2 7 19 10 3 8 17\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}, {"input": "15 30\n20 24 17 13 26 8 5 6 27 14 18 22 25 2 15\n4 12 6 25 3 5 28 11 15 21 9 26 7 17 13\n19 20 24 16 2 23 8 29 22 30 1 27 10 14 18\n9 29 3 7 12 28 10 16 23 19 21 1 30 11 4\n", "output": ["-1\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "responses": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "prompt_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "completion_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "no_of_try": 12, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2047}

As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time.

Otherwise, Du won't do anything. \n\nBoboniu's mood is a constant $m$. On the $i$-th day:  If Du can speak and $a_i>m$, then Boboniu will be angry and muzzle him for $d$ days, which means that Du won't be able to speak on the $i+1, i+2, \\cdots, \\min(i+d,n)$-th days.  Otherwise, Boboniu won't do anything. \n\nThe total fun factor is the sum of the fun factors on the days when Du can speak.\n\nDu asked you to find the maximum total fun factor among all possible permutations of $a$.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains three integers $n$, $d$ and $m$ ($1\\le d\\le n\\le 10^5,0\\le m\\le 10^9$).\n\nThe next line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \\ldots,a_n$ ($0\\le a_i\\le 10^9$).\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint one integer: the maximum total fun factor among all permutations of $a$.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 2 11\n8 10 15 23 5\n\nOutput\n48\n\nInput\n20 2 16\n20 5 8 2 18 16 2 16 16 1 5 16 2 13 6 16 4 17 21 7\n\nOutput\n195\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first example, you can set $a'=[15, 5, 8, 10, 23]$. Then Du's chatting record will be:  Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $15$.  Be muzzled.  Be muzzled.  Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $10$.  Make fun of Boboniu with fun factor $23$. \n\nThus the total fun factor is $48$.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2146, "sample_io": [{"input": "5 2 11\n8 10 15 23 5\n", "output": ["48\n"]}, {"input": "20 2 16\n20 5 8 2 18 16 2 16 16 1 5 16 2 13 6 16 4 17 21 7\n", "output": ["195\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "5 2 11\n8 10 15 23 5\n", "output": ["48\n"]}, {"input": "20 2 16\n20 5 8 2 18 16 2 16 16 1 5 16 2 13 6 16 4 17 21 7\n", "output": ["195\n"]}, {"input": "1 1 0\n0\n", "output": ["0\n"]}, {"input": "100 61 71\n11 18 0 47 33 75 91 13 8 21 73 64 50 97 62 50 2 36 68 32 64 74 32 77 81 41 23 44 40 36 45 33 21 68 57 79 75 23 67 37 99 27 30 56 75 62 75 63 46 19 79 42 11 66 21 25 2 12 89 48 75 7 57 85 80 14 82 29 66 47 29 10 1 84 79 39 33 81 73 51 80 67 52 25 38 68 57 53 38 83 83 3 86 29 50 46 3 68 88 10\n", "output": ["2765\n"]}, {"input": "10 3 10\n17 17 17 8 7 6 5 4 1 1\n", "output": ["64\n"]}, {"input": "79 14 68\n55 91 81 39 60 85 43 53 41 12 23 70 26 61 51 92 52 23 78 41 20 49 38 57 86 77 59 74 86 12 8 79 32 70 69 43 78 37 88 71 22 0 21 21 30 3 76 87 98 52 83 66 79 60 56 31 19 89 73 81 79 16 76 79 94 23 65 7 53 81 21 63 11 31 35 17 31 65 89\n", "output": ["2038\n"]}, {"input": "39 37 39\n38 56 198 166 86 51 13 54 101 143 82 138 122 146 86 198 81 177 92 56 107 58 124 82 41 126 79 47 191 41 188 108 38 12 18 57 68 134 79\n", "output": ["396\n"]}, {"input": "4 4 8\n84 25 75 21\n", "output": ["84\n"]}, {"input": "5 3 3\n8 5 5 1 14\n", "output": ["22\n"]}, {"input": "1 1 1\n2\n", "output": ["2\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "responses": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "prompt_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "completion_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "no_of_try": 12, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2146}

He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 T, 1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 1000) each \u2014 the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests.

This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha.

A matryoshka with a smaller number can be nested in a matryoshka with a higher number, two matryoshkas can not be directly nested in the same doll, but there may be chain nestings, for example, 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 4 \u2192 5. \n\nIn one second, you can perform one of the two following operations:  Having a matryoshka a that isn't nested in any other matryoshka and a matryoshka b, such that b doesn't contain any other matryoshka and is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may put a in b;  Having a matryoshka a directly contained in matryoshka b, such that b is not nested in any other matryoshka, you may get a out of b. \n\nAccording to the modern aesthetic norms the matryoshka dolls on display were assembled in a specific configuration, i.e. as several separate chains of nested matryoshkas, but the criminal, following the mysterious plan, took out all the dolls and assembled them into a single large chain (1 \u2192 2 \u2192 ... \u2192 n). In order to continue the investigation Andrewid needs to know in what minimum time it is possible to perform this action.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n (1 \u2264 n \u2264 10^5) and k (1 \u2264 k \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of matryoshkas and matryoshka chains in the initial configuration.\n\nThe next k lines contain the descriptions of the chains: the i-th line first contains number m_{i} (1 \u2264 m_{i} \u2264 n), and then m_{i} numbers a_{i}1, a_{i}2, ..., a_{im}_{i} \u2014 the numbers of matryoshkas in the chain (matryoshka a_{i}1 is nested into matryoshka a_{i}2, that is nested into matryoshka a_{i}3, and so on till the matryoshka a_{im}_{i} that isn't nested into any other matryoshka).\n\nIt is guaranteed that m_1 + m_2 + ... + m_{k} = n, the numbers of matryoshkas in all the chains are distinct, in each chain the numbers of matryoshkas follow in the ascending order.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn the single line print the minimum number of seconds needed to assemble one large chain from the initial configuration.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n\nOutput\n1\n\nInput\n7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test there are two chains: 1 \u2192 2 and 3. In one second you can nest the first chain into the second one and get 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3.\n\nIn the second sample test you need to disassemble all the three chains into individual matryoshkas in 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 seconds and then assemble one big chain in 6 seconds.", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2065, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 2\n2 1 2\n1 3\n", "output": ["1\n"]}, {"input": "7 3\n3 1 3 7\n2 2 5\n2 4 6\n", "output": ["10\n"]}, {"input": "1 1\n1 1\n", "output": ["0\n"]}, {"input": "3 2\n1 2\n2 1 3\n", "output": ["3\n"]}, {"input": "5 3\n1 4\n3 1 2 3\n1 5\n", "output": ["2\n"]}, {"input": "8 5\n2 1 2\n2 3 4\n1 5\n2 6 7\n1 8\n", "output": ["8\n"]}, {"input": "10 10\n1 5\n1 4\n1 10\n1 3\n1 7\n1 1\n1 8\n1 6\n1 9\n1 2\n", "output": ["9\n"]}, {"input": "20 6\n3 8 9 13\n3 4 14 20\n2 15 17\n3 2 5 11\n5 7 10 12 18 19\n4 1 3 6 16\n", "output": ["33\n"]}, {"input": "50 10\n6 17 21 31 42 45 49\n6 11 12 15 22 26 38\n3 9 29 36\n3 10 23 43\n5 14 19 28 46 48\n2 30 39\n6 13 20 24 33 37 47\n8 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8\n7 16 18 25 27 34 40 44\n4 32 35 41 50\n", "output": ["75\n"]}, {"input": "13 8\n1 5\n2 8 10\n1 13\n4 1 2 3 11\n1 7\n2 6 12\n1 4\n1 9\n", "output": ["13\n"]}, {"input": "21 13\n1 18\n2 8 13\n1 21\n1 17\n2 7 9\n1 20\n1 19\n1 4\n1 16\n2 5 6\n3 12 14 15\n3 1 2 3\n2 10 11\n", "output": ["24\n"]}, {"input": "50 50\n1 2\n1 5\n1 28\n1 46\n1 42\n1 24\n1 3\n1 37\n1 33\n1 50\n1 23\n1 40\n1 43\n1 26\n1 49\n1 34\n1 8\n1 45\n1 15\n1 1\n1 22\n1 18\n1 27\n1 25\n1 13\n1 39\n1 38\n1 10\n1 44\n1 6\n1 17\n1 47\n1 7\n1 35\n1 20\n1 36\n1 31\n1 21\n1 32\n1 29\n1 4\n1 12\n1 19\n1 16\n1 11\n1 41\n1 9\n1 14\n1 30\n1 48\n", "output": ["49\n"]}, {"input": "100 3\n45 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 19 21 24 27 28 30 34 35 37 39 40 41 42 43 46 47 48 51 52 55 58 59 61 63 64 66 69 71 76 80 85 86 88 89 94 99\n26 10 11 15 18 23 29 31 33 36 38 44 49 54 56 60 62 65 75 78 82 83 84 95 96 97 98\n29 12 13 14 16 17 20 22 25 26 32 45 50 53 57 67 68 70 72 73 74 77 79 81 87 90 91 92 93 100\n", "output": ["180\n"]}, {"input": "100 19\n6 62 72 83 91 94 97\n3 61 84 99\n1 63\n5 46 53 56 69 78\n5 41 43 49 74 89\n5 55 57 79 85 87\n3 47 59 98\n3 64 76 82\n3 48 66 75\n2 60 88\n2 67 77\n4 40 51 73 95\n41 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 44 71 81\n4 58 65 90 93\n1 100\n5 39 45 52 80 86\n2 50 68\n1 92\n4 42 54 70 96\n", "output": ["106\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "responses": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "prompt_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "completion_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "no_of_try": 12, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2065}

For this reason, two words \"ulyana\" and \"oolyana\" denote the same name.\n\nThe second ambiguity is about the Berland sound h: one can use both \"h\" and \"kh\" to write it. For example, the words \"mihail\" and \"mikhail\" denote the same name.\n\nThere are n users registered on the Polycarp's website. Each of them indicated a name represented by the Latin letters.

Each edge should be in exactly two cycles.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3\n\nOutput\n2\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n\nInput\n5\n\nOutput\n6\n3 5 4 2\n3 3 1 5\n4 4 5 2 3\n4 4 3 2 1\n3 4 2 1\n3 3 1 5", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2153, "sample_io": [{"input": "3\n", "output": ["2\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n"]}, {"input": "5\n", "output": ["6\n3 1 2 3\n3 2 3 4\n3 3 4 5\n3 4 5 1\n4 2 1 3 5\n4 5 1 4 2\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3\n", "output": ["2\n3 1 2 3\n3 1 2 3\n"]}, {"input": "5\n", "output": ["6\n3 1 2 3\n3 2 3 4\n3 3 4 5\n3 4 5 1\n4 2 1 3 5\n4 5 1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "4\n", "output": ["4\n3 4 1 2\n3 2 3 4\n3 1 2 3\n3 3 4 1\n"]}, {"input": "5\n", "output": ["6\n3 1 2 3\n3 2 3 4\n3 3 4 5\n3 4 5 1\n4 2 1 3 5\n4 5 1 4 2\n"]}, {"input": "6\n", "output": ["9\n3 6 1 2\n4 6 2 5 3\n3 3 4 5\n3 1 2 3\n4 1 3 6 4\n3 4 5 6\n3 2 3 4\n4 2 4 1 5\n3 5 6 1\n"]}, {"input": "7\n", "output": ["12\n4 2 3 1 4\n4 3 4 2 5\n4 4 5 3 6\n4 5 6 4 7\n4 6 7 5 1\n4 7 1 6 2\n3 2 5 6\n3 1 5 4\n3 3 6 7\n3 7 4 3\n3 3 2 1\n3 7 1 2\n"]}, {"input": "8\n", "output": ["16\n3 8 1 2\n4 8 2 7 3\n4 7 3 6 4\n3 4 5 6\n3 1 2 3\n4 1 3 8 4\n4 8 4 7 5\n3 5 6 7\n3 2 3 4\n4 2 4 1 5\n4 1 5 8 6\n3 6 7 8\n3 3 4 5\n4 3 5 2 6\n4 2 6 1 7\n3 7 8 1\n"]}, {"input": "9\n", "output": ["20\n3 1 2 3\n4 1 3 9 4\n3 2 3 4\n4 2 4 1 5\n3 3 4 5\n4 3 5 2 6\n3 4 5 6\n4 4 6 3 7\n3 5 6 7\n4 5 7 4 8\n3 6 7 8\n4 6 8 5 9\n3 7 8 9\n4 7 9 6 1\n3 8 9 1\n4 8 1 7 2\n4 2 1 5 9\n4 9 1 6 2\n4 3 9 4 8\n4 8 2 7 3\n"]}, {"input": "10\n", "output": ["25\n3 10 1 2\n4 10 2 9 3\n4 9 3 8 4\n4 8 4 7 5\n3 5 6 7\n3 1 2 3\n4 1 3 10 4\n4 10 4 9 5\n4 9 5 8 6\n3 6 7 8\n3 2 3 4\n4 2 4 1 5\n4 1 5 10 6\n4 10 6 9 7\n3 7 8 9\n3 3 4 5\n4 3 5 2 6\n4 2 6 1 7\n4 1 7 10 8\n3 8 9 10\n3 4 5 6\n4 4 6 3 7\n4 3 7 2 8\n4 2 8 1 9\n3 9 10 1\n"]}, {"input": "11\n", "output": ["30\n4 2 3 1 4\n4 1 4 11 5\n4 3 4 2 5\n4 2 5 1 6\n4 4 5 3 6\n4 3 6 2 7\n4 5 6 4 7\n4 4 7 3 8\n4 6 7 5 8\n4 5 8 4 9\n4 7 8 6 9\n4 6 9 5 10\n4 8 9 7 10\n4 7 10 6 11\n4 9 10 8 11\n4 8 11 7 1\n4 10 11 9 1\n4 9 1 8 2\n4 11 1 10 2\n4 10 2 9 3\n3 2 7 8\n3 1 7 6\n3 3 8 9\n3 11 6 5\n3 4 9 10\n3 10 5 4\n3 3 2 1\n3 11 1 2\n3 4 3 11\n3 10 11 3\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "responses": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "prompt_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "completion_tokens": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], "no_of_try": 12, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2153}
