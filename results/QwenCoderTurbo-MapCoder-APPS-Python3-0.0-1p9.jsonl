She began to write a light novel for the kingdom as soon as she woke up, and of course, she is the queen of it.\n\n[Image]\u00a0\n\nThere are $n$ cities and $n-1$ two-way roads connecting pairs of cities in the kingdom. From any city, you can reach any other city by walking through some roads. The cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$, and the city $1$ is the capital of the kingdom. So, the kingdom has a tree structure.\n\nAs the queen, Linova plans to choose exactly $k$ cities developing industry, while the other cities will develop tourism. The capital also can be either industrial or tourism city.\n\nA meeting is held in the capital once a year. To attend the meeting, each industry city sends an envoy. All envoys will follow the shortest path from the departure city to the capital (which is unique).\n\nTraveling in tourism cities is pleasant. For each envoy, his happiness is equal to the number of tourism cities on his path.\n\nIn order to be a queen loved by people, Linova wants to choose $k$ cities which can maximize the sum of happinesses of all envoys.

As Allen is planning out all of the different types of cars he will own and how he will arrange them, he realizes that he has a problem. \n\nAllen's future parking lot can be represented as a rectangle with $4$ rows and $n$ ($n \\le 50$) columns of rectangular spaces, each of which can contain at most one car at any time. He imagines having $k$ ($k \\le 2n$) cars in the grid, and all the cars are initially in the second and third rows. Each of the cars also has a different designated parking space in the first or fourth row. Allen has to put the cars into corresponding parking places.\n\n [Image] Illustration to the first example. \n\nHowever, since Allen would never entrust his cars to anyone else, only one car can be moved at a time. He can drive a car from a space in any of the four cardinal directions to a neighboring empty space. Furthermore, Allen can only move one of his cars into a space on the first or fourth rows if it is the car's designated parking space. \n\nAllen knows he will be a very busy man, and will only have time to move cars at most $20000$ times before he realizes that moving cars is not worth his time.

{"name": "2026", "description": "Yaroslav is playing a game called \"Time\". The game has a timer showing the lifespan he's got left. As soon as the timer shows 0, Yaroslav's character dies and the game ends. Also, the game has n clock stations, station number i is at point (x_{i}, y_{i}) of the plane. As the player visits station number i, he increases the current time on his timer by a_{i}. The stations are for one-time use only, so if the player visits some station another time, the time on his timer won't grow.\n\nA player spends d\u00b7dist time units to move between stations, where dist is the distance the player has covered and d is some constant. The distance between stations i and j is determined as |x_{i} - x_{j}| + |y_{i} - y_{j}|.\n\nInitially, the player is at station number 1, and the player has strictly more than zero and strictly less than one units of time. At station number 1 one unit of money can increase the time on the timer by one time unit (you can buy only integer number of time units).\n\nNow Yaroslav is wondering, how much money he needs to get to station n. Help Yaroslav. Consider the time to buy and to increase the timer value negligibly small.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains integers n and d (3 \u2264 n \u2264 100, 10^3 \u2264 d \u2264 10^5) \u2014 the number of stations and the constant from the statement.\n\nThe second line contains n - 2 integers: a_2, a_3, ..., a_{n} - 1 (1 \u2264 a_{i} \u2264 10^3). The next n lines contain the coordinates of the stations. The i-th of them contains two integers x_{i}, y_{i} (-100 \u2264 x_{i}, y_{i} \u2264 100).\n\nIt is guaranteed that no two stations are located at the same point.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nIn a single line print an integer \u2014 the answer to the problem.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n\nOutput\n2000\n\nInput\n3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n\nOutput\n1000", "difficulty": "competition", "id": 2026, "sample_io": [{"input": "3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n", "output": ["2000\n"]}, {"input": "3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}], "test_list": [{"input": "3 1000\n1000\n0 0\n0 1\n0 3\n", "output": ["2000\n"]}, {"input": "3 1000\n1000\n1 0\n1 1\n1 2\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}, {"input": "5 1421\n896 448 727\n-19 -40\n-87 40\n69 51\n-55 61\n-7 67\n", "output": ["169099\n"]}, {"input": "6 1000\n142 712 254 869\n7 0\n95 38\n96 -20\n-7 93\n75 -45\n-80 -20\n", "output": ["107000\n"]}, {"input": "7 1288\n943 265 649 447 806\n-4 -51\n-26 32\n47 -28\n31 32\n61 65\n-45 -37\n82 42\n", "output": ["229903\n"]}, {"input": "8 1931\n440 627 324 538 539 119\n-85 -41\n-91 61\n-84 11\n92 -19\n8 -5\n16 -25\n97 -98\n91 78\n", "output": ["569018\n"]}, {"input": "9 1829\n98 513 987 291 162 637 356\n38 -3\n-89 93\n-86 45\n-43 -84\n-3 -87\n53 -59\n18 -19\n81 -74\n-85 32\n", "output": ["288982\n"]}, {"input": "10 1000\n759 222 589 423 947 507 31 414\n-4 -71\n-31 -53\n24 28\n-13 -65\n-59 -49\n-42 -79\n85 -71\n-60 -17\n28 66\n74 2\n", "output": ["151000\n"]}, {"input": "11 1199\n282 735 54 1000 419 939 901 789 128\n10 -81\n26 72\n19 -91\n-61 85\n0 -33\n-62 79\n-59 65\n-2 -77\n-63 100\n-15 53\n94 54\n", "output": ["262581\n"]}, {"input": "12 1609\n196 486 94 344 524 588 315 504 449 201\n86 -22\n-2 25\n-95 -8\n-5 -30\n-78 71\n5 -54\n-69 -92\n-41 0\n10 19\n61 17\n75 -39\n-46 22\n", "output": ["282231\n"]}, {"input": "3 97325\n40\n43 43\n45 -95\n-93 63\n", "output": ["15182700\n"]}, {"input": "11 1615\n137 681 199 33 388 585 241 518 7\n-60 89\n24 6\n-100 -55\n-26 -90\n-40 -33\n-100 28\n12 34\n-60 -13\n38 -89\n62 81\n-35 54\n", "output": ["96900\n"]}, {"input": "4 62071\n706 480\n6 96\n51 -12\n99 66\n-69 -61\n", "output": ["14400472\n"]}, {"input": "12 1542\n389 356 290 648 182 94 585 988 762 494\n-46 96\n1 88\n0 95\n-91 -100\n-42 -29\n45 -27\n-52 -34\n-62 27\n-19 46\n-100 95\n5 -55\n-36 -65\n", "output": ["263034\n"]}, {"input": "3 100000\n1\n-100 -100\n-100 -99\n100 100\n", "output": ["39999999\n"]}, {"input": "12 1211\n1 5 7 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000 1000\n1 1\n5 5\n3 4\n4 3\n0 1\n0 2\n0 5\n0 7\n1 0\n3 0\n8 0\n10 10\n", "output": ["20220\n"]}, {"input": "6 1000\n1000 1000 1000 1000\n0 0\n0 -1\n1 -1\n2 -1\n2 0\n2 1\n", "output": ["1000\n"]}], "starter_code": "", "source_codes": [""], "responses": [""], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "api_calls": 8, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": 2026}

He has already made n tasks, for each task the boy evaluated how interesting it is as an integer q_{i}, and the time t_{i} in minutes needed to complete the task. \n\nAn interesting feature of his quest is: each participant should get the task that is best suited for him, depending on his preferences. The task is chosen based on an interactive quiz that consists of some questions. The player should answer these questions with \"yes\" or \"no\". Depending on the answer to the question, the participant either moves to another question or goes to one of the tasks that are in the quest. In other words, the quest is a binary tree, its nodes contain questions and its leaves contain tasks. \n\nWe know that answering any of the questions that are asked before getting a task takes exactly one minute from the quest player. Polycarp knows that his friends are busy people and they can't participate in the quest for more than T minutes. Polycarp wants to choose some of the n tasks he made, invent the corresponding set of questions for them and use them to form an interactive quiz as a binary tree so that no matter how the player answers quiz questions, he spends at most T minutes on completing the whole quest (that is, answering all the questions and completing the task). Specifically, the quest can contain zero questions and go straight to the task. Each task can only be used once (i.e., the people who give different answers to questions should get different tasks).\n\nPolycarp wants the total \"interest\" value of the tasks involved in the quest to be as large as possible. Help him determine the maximum possible total interest value of the task considering that the quest should be completed in T minutes at any variant of answering questions.\n\n\n-----Input-----\n\nThe first line contains two integers n and T (1 \u2264 n \u2264 1000, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 100) \u2014 the number of tasks made by Polycarp and the maximum time a quest player should fit into.\n\nNext n lines contain two integers t_{i}, q_{i} (1 \u2264 t_{i} \u2264 T, 1 \u2264 q_{i} \u2264 1000) each \u2014 the time in minutes needed to complete the i-th task and its interest value.\n\n\n-----Output-----\n\nPrint a single integer \u2014 the maximum possible total interest value of all the tasks in the quest.\n\n\n-----Examples-----\nInput\n5 5\n1 1\n1 1\n2 2\n3 3\n4 4\n\nOutput\n11\n\nInput\n5 5\n4 1\n4 2\n4 3\n4 4\n4 5\n\nOutput\n9\n\nInput\n2 2\n1 1\n2 10\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\n\n-----Note-----\n\nIn the first sample test all the five tasks can be complemented with four questions and joined into one quest.\n\nIn the second sample test it is impossible to use all the five tasks, but you can take two of them, the most interesting ones.\n\nIn the third sample test the optimal strategy is to include only the second task into the quest.\n\nHere is the picture that illustrates the answers to the sample tests.

{"name": "2066", "description": "In the official contest this problem has a different statement, for which jury's solution was working incorrectly, and for this reason it was excluded from the contest. This mistake have been fixed and the current given problem statement and model solution corresponds to what jury wanted it to be during the contest.\n\nVova and Lesha are friends. They often meet at Vova's place and compete against each other in a computer game named The Ancient Papyri: Swordsink. Vova always chooses a warrior as his fighter and Leshac chooses an archer. After that they should choose initial positions for their characters and start the fight. A warrior is good at melee combat, so Vova will try to make the distance between fighters as small as possible. An archer prefers to keep the enemy at a distance, so Lesha will try to make the initial distance as large as possible.\n\nThere are n (n is always even) possible starting positions for characters marked along the Ox axis. The positions are given by their distinct coordinates x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n}, two characters cannot end up at the same position.\n\nVova and Lesha take turns banning available positions, Vova moves first. During each turn one of the guys bans exactly one of the remaining positions. Banned positions cannot be used by both Vova and Lesha.
