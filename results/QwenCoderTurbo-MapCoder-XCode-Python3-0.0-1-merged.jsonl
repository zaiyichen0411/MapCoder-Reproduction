{"description": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of $$$s$$$ be $$$|s|$$$. You may perform several operations on this string.In one operation, you can choose some index $$$i$$$ and remove the $$$i$$$-th character of $$$s$$$ ($$$s_i$$$) if at least one of its adjacent characters is the previous letter in the Latin alphabet for $$$s_i$$$. For example, the previous letter for b is a, the previous letter for s is r, the letter a has no previous letters. Note that after each removal the length of the string decreases by one. So, the index $$$i$$$ should satisfy the condition $$$1 \\le i \\le |s|$$$ during each operation.For the character $$$s_i$$$ adjacent characters are $$$s_{i-1}$$$ and $$$s_{i+1}$$$. The first and the last characters of $$$s$$$ both have only one adjacent character (unless $$$|s| = 1$$$).Consider the following example. Let $$$s=$$$ bacabcab.  During the first move, you can remove the first character $$$s_1=$$$ b because $$$s_2=$$$ a. Then the string becomes $$$s=$$$ acabcab.  During the second move, you can remove the fifth character $$$s_5=$$$ c because $$$s_4=$$$ b. Then the string becomes $$$s=$$$ acabab.  During the third move, you can remove the sixth character $$$s_6=$$$'b' because $$$s_5=$$$ a. Then the string becomes $$$s=$$$ acaba.  During the fourth move, the only character you can remove is $$$s_4=$$$ b, because $$$s_3=$$$ a (or $$$s_5=$$$ a). The string becomes $$$s=$$$ acaa and you cannot do anything with it.

{"description": "The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of $$$n$$$ intersections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection $$$v$$$ to another intersection $$$u$$$ is the path that starts in $$$v$$$, ends in $$$u$$$ and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection $$$s$$$ and works in a building near the intersection $$$t$$$. Every day he gets from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_k$$$, where $$$p_1 = s$$$, $$$p_k = t$$$, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp's path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.Polycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection $$$s$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as $$$v$$$. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $$$s$$$ to $$$v$$$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $$$v$$$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $$$w$$$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $$$w$$$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $$$w$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $$$t$$$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ ($$$s = 1$$$, $$$t = 4$$$): Check the picture by the link http://tk.codeforces.com/a.png   When Polycarp starts at $$$1$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. There is only one such path, it is $$$[1, 5, 4]$$$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$2$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$2$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, for example, $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ (note that it could choose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$3$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$3$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$, which is $$$[3, 4]$$$;  Polycarp arrives at $$$4$$$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. Overall, we get $$$2$$$ rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$ instead of $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ during the second step, there would be only $$$1$$$ rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path $$$[3, 4]$$$ during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same.

Winner is the one who scores the most. In case of ties, one of the top-scorers will be declared as the winner randomly with equal probability.They have just finished the game and now are waiting for the result. But there's a tiny problem! The judges have lost the paper of scores! Fortunately they have calculated sum of the scores before they get lost and also for some of the players they have remembered a lower bound on how much they scored. However, the information about the bounds is private, so Hasan only got to know his bound.According to the available data, he knows that his score is at least $$$r$$$ and sum of the scores is $$$s$$$.Thus the final state of the game can be represented in form of sequence of $$$p$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i$$$) — player's scores. Hasan is player number $$$1$$$, so $$$a_1 \\ge r$$$. Also $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_p = s$$$. Two states are considered different if there exists some position $$$i$$$ such that the value of $$$a_i$$$ differs in these states. Once again, Hasan doesn't know the exact scores (he doesn't know his exact score as well). So he considers each of the final states to be equally probable to achieve.Help Hasan find the probability of him winning.It can be shown that it is in the form of $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are non-negative integers and $$$Q \\ne 0$$$, $$$P \\le Q$$$.

{"description": "The Floral Clock has been standing by the side of Mirror Lake for years. Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days.On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well — symmetry is beautiful!Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n = 6 that cover all possibilities.  The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments. Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty equals 0. For instance, the beauty of the above arrangement equals 1 × 3 × 1 × 3 = 9 — the segments are {2}, {4, 5, 6}, {8} and {10, 11, 12}.While keeping the constraints satisfied, there may be lots of different arrangements.

{"description": "Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vičkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vičkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers A and B and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"A factorial\" and \"B factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(A!, B!).

Petya conducted a thorough analysis of his program and found out that his function for finding maximum element in an array of n positive integers was too slow. Desperate, Petya decided to use a somewhat unexpected optimization using parameter k, so now his function contains the following code:int fast_max(int n, int a[]) {     int ans = 0;    int offset = 0;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)        if (ans &lt; a[i]) {            ans = a[i];            offset = 0;        } else {            offset = offset + 1;            if (offset == k)                return ans;        }    return ans;}That way the function iteratively checks array elements, storing the intermediate maximum, and if after k consecutive iterations that maximum has not changed, it is returned as the answer.Now Petya is interested in fault rate of his function.

{"description": "Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p = [p1, p2, ..., pn] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on.Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p = [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] is (421)(5)(63).Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] will become [4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 3].Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list.

Similarly, the black queen doesn't have any other options but to capture the green pawn located at (2, 3), otherwise if it goes to the middle vertical line, it will be captured by the white queen.During the next move the same thing happens — neither the white, nor the black queen has other options rather than to capture green pawns situated above them.

Jacob has spent ai minutes building the i-th ball in the tree.Jacob's teacher will evaluate his model and grade Jacob based on the effort he has put in. However, she does not have enough time to search his whole tree to determine this; Jacob knows that she will examine the first k nodes in a DFS-order traversal of the tree.

Furthermore, he can rearrange the list of neighbors of each node in any order he likes. Help Jacob find the best grade he can get on this assignment.A DFS-order traversal is an ordering of the nodes of a rooted tree, built by a recursive DFS-procedure initially called on the root of the tree. When called on a given node v, the procedure does the following:   Print v.  Traverse the list of neighbors of the node v in order and iteratively call DFS-procedure on each one.

The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. The content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.And he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. For example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".After receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.At a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ...

{"description": "Little Petya is learning to play chess. He has already learned how to move a king, a rook and a bishop. Let us remind you the rules of moving chess pieces. A chessboard is 64 square fields organized into an 8 × 8 table. A field is represented by a pair of integers (r, c) — the number of the row and the number of the column (in a classical game the columns are traditionally indexed by letters). Each chess piece takes up exactly one field. To make a move is to move a chess piece, the pieces move by the following rules:  A rook moves any number of fields horizontally or vertically.  A bishop moves any number of fields diagonally.  A king moves one field in any direction — horizontally, vertically or diagonally.     The pieces move like that Petya is thinking about the following problem: what minimum number of moves is needed for each of these pieces to move from field (r1, c1) to field (r2, c2)?

After the bear eats the raspberry from k bushes, he increases each component of his speed by k. In other words, if before eating the k bushes of raspberry his speed was (dx, dy), then after eating the berry his speed equals (dx + k, dy + k).

The protein is nonfunctional because sequence \"TT\" has even length.Manao is trying to obtain a functional protein from the protein he currently has.

Then the spectator should guess which cup hides the marble.But the head coder of the F company isn't easy to trick. When he saw the performance, he noticed several important facts:  each cup contains a mark — a number from 1 to n; all marks on the cups are distinct;  the magician shuffles the cups in m operations, each operation looks like that: take a cup marked xi, sitting at position yi in the row of cups (the positions are numbered from left to right, starting from 1) and shift it to the very beginning of the cup row (on the first position). When the head coder came home after work he wanted to re-do the trick. Unfortunately, he didn't remember the starting or the final position of the cups. He only remembered which operations the magician performed.

For example, if Iahub has the row of balls [black, black, white, white, black, black] and a white ball, he can insert the ball between two white balls.

After one second Petya chooses a certain action for each spider, and all of them humbly perform its commands. There are 5 possible commands: to stay idle or to move from current cell to some of the four side-neighboring cells (that is, one command for each of the four possible directions).

{"description": "To get money for a new aeonic blaster, ranger Qwerty decided to engage in trade for a while. He wants to buy some number of items (or probably not to buy anything at all) on one of the planets, and then sell the bought items on another planet. Note that this operation is not repeated, that is, the buying and the selling are made only once. To carry out his plan, Qwerty is going to take a bank loan that covers all expenses and to return the loaned money at the end of the operation (the money is returned without the interest).

{"description": "Sometimes one has to spell email addresses over the phone. Then one usually pronounces a dot as dot, an at sign as at. As a result, we get something like vasyaatgmaildotcom. Your task is to transform it into a proper email address (vasya@gmail.com). It is known that a proper email address contains only such symbols as . @ and lower-case Latin letters, doesn't start with and doesn't end with a dot. Also, a proper email address doesn't start with and doesn't end with an at sign. Moreover, an email address contains exactly one such symbol as @, yet may contain any number (possible, zero) of dots. You have to carry out a series of replacements so that the length of the result was as short as possible and it was a proper email address. If the lengths are equal, you should print the lexicographically minimal result. Overall, two variants of replacement are possible: dot can be replaced by a dot, at can be replaced by an at.
