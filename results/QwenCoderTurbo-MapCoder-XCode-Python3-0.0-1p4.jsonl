{"description": "You will receive 3 points for solving this problem.Manao is designing the genetic code for a new type of algae to efficiently produce fuel. Specifically, Manao is focusing on a stretch of DNA that encodes one protein. The stretch of DNA is represented by a string containing only the characters 'A', 'T', 'G' and 'C'.Manao has determined that if the stretch of DNA contains a maximal sequence of consecutive identical nucleotides that is of even length, then the protein will be nonfunctional. For example, consider a protein described by DNA string \"GTTAAAG\". It contains four maximal sequences of consecutive identical nucleotides: \"G\", \"TT\", \"AAA\", and \"G\". The protein is nonfunctional because sequence \"TT\" has even length.Manao is trying to obtain a functional protein from the protein he currently has. Manao can insert additional nucleotides into the DNA stretch. Each additional nucleotide is a character from the set {'A', 'T', 'G', 'C'}.

Then the spectator should guess which cup hides the marble.But the head coder of the F company isn't easy to trick. When he saw the performance, he noticed several important facts:  each cup contains a mark \u2014 a number from 1 to n; all marks on the cups are distinct;  the magician shuffles the cups in m operations, each operation looks like that: take a cup marked xi, sitting at position yi in the row of cups (the positions are numbered from left to right, starting from 1) and shift it to the very beginning of the cup row (on the first position). When the head coder came home after work he wanted to re-do the trick. Unfortunately, he didn't remember the starting or the final position of the cups.

He wants to buy some number of items (or probably not to buy anything at all) on one of the planets, and then sell the bought items on another planet.

To carry out his plan, Qwerty is going to take a bank loan that covers all expenses and to return the loaned money at the end of the operation (the money is returned without the interest). At the same time, Querty wants to get as much profit as possible.The system has n planets in total. On each of them Qwerty can buy or sell items of m types (such as food, medicine, weapons, alcohol, and so on). For each planet i and each type of items j Qwerty knows the following: aij \u2014 the cost of buying an item;  bij \u2014 the cost of selling an item;  cij \u2014 the number of remaining items.It is not allowed to buy more than cij items of type j on planet i, but it is allowed to sell any number of items of any kind.Knowing that the hold of Qwerty's ship has room for no more than k items, determine the maximum profit which Qwerty can get.", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "2 seconds", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "The first line contains three space-separated integers n, m and k (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200910, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009m,\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u2009100) \u2014 the number of planets, the number of question types and the capacity of Qwerty's ship hold, correspondingly.

{"description": "Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget \u2014 a rotating camera \u2014 come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation \u2014 to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

The condition is: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. So the first digit cannot be zero. The hint's first character s[0] is not '0' (as per input guarantee). So we have to enforce that for possible codes, the first digit must be non-zero. This constraint will affect counts when s[0] is '?' or a letter assigned to the first position, etc. Also for letters, they must be assigned distinct digits 0-9, each letter A-J is distinct variable.\n\n- digits '0'..'9' which is fixed digit.\n\n- letters 'A'..'J', with constraints: same letter => same digit; different letters => distinct digits.\n\nGoal: count number of possible safe codes satisfying hint and also have no leading zero (i.e., first digit cannot be zero). Count up to large numbers; answer may be huge (up to 10^?), but we need to output the integer count (presumably fits in 64-bit? Possibly larger). But given |s| up to 100k, counts may be huge (10^(100k)!). But likely we need to output number modulo something? The problem statement says just print the number. However typical Codeforces style problem (#???). Let's search memory: There is a known problem \"C. Codeforces Round #...\" where they ask to count number of possible numbers matching pattern with letters, digits, and ?. There's a known problem: \"Special Agent Smart Beaver\" maybe from some contest. The output may be a huge number that may need big integer printing. Python can handle arbitrary large integer. So we can just compute combinatorial count using Python big ints. But careful: for length up to 1e5, the number could be monstrous (10^(1e5)). Python's big integer memory consumption would be huge if we compute power huge numbers directly? But maybe the pattern reduces possibilities drastically because letters restrict distinct digits, leading to at most 10! * ... combos. Actually letters up to 10 distinct letters, each must be a distinct digit 0-9. So maximum number of distinct letters is <=10. So the factor for letters assignment is at most 10P (permutations of digits of size k). That's bounded by 10! = 3628800. Then for '?' positions each gives factor up to 10. So overall count <= 10! * 10^#question. For N up to 100k, could be 10^(#question) huge, but Python can store integer with arbitrary length; it would have about (#question) * log10(10) = #question decimal digits. If #question is 100k, that's 100k digits, which is large but Python can handle storing a 100k-digit integer? Possibly memory ~ 100k bytes ~ 100KB. Actually Python's big ints store binary; each digit is 30 bits (or 15 bits). So 100k decimal digits = about log2(10)*100k \u2248 332k bits ~ 42KB. That's fine. But computing 10**100k might produce huge integer? 10**100k is a huge integer with 100001 digits (1 followed by 100k zeros). That's also ~ 50KB memory. So okay.\n\nBut we need to handle multiplications of such large numbers maybe 10! * 10^k. That's similar magnitude. So we can compute count as integer using Python's pow and multiplication.\n\nPotential nuance: leading zero restriction. The safe code has no leading zeroes overall; i.e., the first digit cannot be zero. Given the hint's first character is not '0', but could be '?', 'A'-'J', or a digit 1-9. If it's '?' we must only consider digits 1-9 (9 possibilities) for the first position (since 0 not allowed). If it's a letter, that letter's assigned digit cannot be zero. If it's a digit, it's fixed to that digit, and we just accept. If it's any other symbol? only those.\n\nSo we need to count assignments to letters A-J that assign distinct digits 0-9, satisfying restrictions like:\n\n- If a letter appears at position 0 (first character), its assigned digit cannot be 0 (to avoid leading zero). Actually that is requirement for whole number: the first digit cannot be zero. So if the first character is a letter, the assigned digit must be non-zero. If it's '?' we restrict to digits 1-9. If it's a digit, we must ensure it's non-zero: input guarantee ensures it's not '0', but digits 0 appear in other positions permitted.\n\nThus the count for assignments to letters also depends on which letters appear at first position (maybe more than one letter appears: but if a letter appears at multiple positions, the same digit across all those positions). For any letter that appears at first position, its digit cannot be zero; other letters that do not appear at first position can be zero as long as distinctness is satisfied.\n\nThus the counting approach: We have at most 10 distinct letters. Let k = number of distinct letters. There may be some letters that appear at the first position (if s[0] is letter). Because there is only one first position, it can be at most one distinct letter that appears there, i.e., either s[0] is a letter or not. So if s[0] is letter X, then X cannot be assigned digit 0. Otherwise, there is no restriction on letter assignments regarding zero.\n\nBut also note that if any letter appears at any position that has a fixed digit (like letter 'A' appears where s[i] is digit 5), then the assigned digit for A must be 5. So that imposes constraints on assignments.\n\nThus we need to handle constraints: For each letter, if there is a position where s[i] is a digit, that letter must map to that digit. If there are conflicting digits for same letter (multiple digits), then no possible assignments => answer is 0.\n\nAlso letters may have constraints that they cannot be 0 if they appear in leading position, but also they might be forced to a certain digit >0, which is fine. So we need to count the number of injective maps from letters to digits 0-9 satisfying constraints, with the extra restriction that if letter appears at leading position, its digit !=0.\n\nThen for each '?' we multiply by 10 (or 9 for the first position's '?'), unless there is a letter at that position? Actually if s[i] = '?', then the digit at i can be any 0-9, independent of others, except for leading constraint. So each '?' multiplies by 10, except if i=0 multiply by 9.\n\nIf s[i] is a fixed digit, no multiplication factor.\n\nIf s[i] is a letter, it's part of mapping constraints; after we choose mapping for letters, those positions are fixed to that digit. So no further multiplication factor for those positions beyond the mapping.\n\nThus the answer = (number of valid assignments of letters) * (10^(#question marks not at position 0)) * (9 if s[0] == '?' else 1).\n\nBut need to be careful if leading character is a letter, mapping for that letter must be non-zero, which reduces assignment count from full permutations of k letters (choose distinct digits for each) to permutations where that specific letter is not assigned digit 0. So we need to compute number of assignments of letters to digits with constraints (some letters have predetermined digits due to occurrences of digit positions; one letter may be forced to a digit that could be 0 or non-zero). The constraints might involve multiple letters: e.g., pattern \"AA0\"? Actually '0' is a digit. Suppose pattern \"A0A\". Then letter 'A' occurs at pos 0 and pos 2; position 1 is digit '0'. Since pos0 is first digit, 'A' cannot be 0 (but that would contradict the occurrence of '0' at pos1; it's a different position; but if 'A' appears elsewhere with digit 0, that is okay because the other position can be zero as long as first digit isn't zero. So only constraint is for first position.\n\nThus algorithm steps:\n\n1. Input string s.\n2. Let n = len(s).\n3. Count positions:\n   - question marks: count_q; if s[0] == '?' then answer_q_factor = 9 else answer_q_factor = 1 (for leading).\n   But careful: If s[0] == '?' we multiply later: base factor for leading question mark is 9 (instead of 10). So compute pow10 = 10**(cnt_q - (1 if s[0]=='?' else 0)) (if cnt_q >0). Then final factor = pow10 * (9 if s[0]=='?' else 1). Actually we can simply compute total_q_factor = (9 if s[0]=='?' else 1) * (10**cnt_q_nolead). This is same.\n\n4. Determine letters and constraints:\n   - Use arrays:\n      forced_digit[letter] = -1 initially (unknown). -2 for conflict or assigned.\n   - For each position i:\n        if s[i] is letter c:\n           letter_idx = ord(c)-ord('A')\n        else ignore.\n\n   - For each position i where s[i] is digit d:\n        If s[i] is digit and also letter? Actually digits are not letters; ignore letters at digit positions.\n   - For each position i where s[i] is digit and next char is letter? Actually not needed.\n\n   - If we encounter a digit position, that's just a fixed digit; that doesn't affect mapping.\n\n   - For letters constraints: we must check any fixed digit constraints:\n        For each position i where s[i] is letter, if there exists some other position j (maybe same i) where s[j] is a digit and the same letter appears at position i? Actually not; the digits are independent.\n\n   But there may also be constraints where the same letter appears in multiple positions, all must have same digit. That's automatically satisfied by mapping, no conflict.\n\n   However there might be constraints where a letter appears in position where a digit is forced? No, that can't happen: digits are fixed digits, not letters.\n\n   However there could be constraints where a letter appears at position i, and at position j (maybe same letter) the hint contains a digit (maybe same letter? No, digits are separate). The constraints are only about same letters mapping to same digit; there is no \"letter equal digit\" constraint. So only mapping constraints are that letters must map to distinct digits, each to a digit 0-9; no digit constraints. So there is no forced mapping for letters (except the leading zero constraint). Right.\n\n   So the only constraints for letter assignment are:\n      - Different letters must have different digits.\n      - Up to 10 distinct letters.\n      - If a letter appears at position 0 (i.e., s[0] is letter), that digit cannot be zero.\n\nThus the count for assignments is: number of injective maps from k letters to digits 0..9, such that if there is a \"restricted\" letter R (first position letter), its assigned digit != 0. If there is no restricted letter (i.e., s[0] is not a letter), then no restriction.\n\nBut we need also to consider letters that appear in first position and are also the only occurrence? That is just the same as restricted.\n\nSo let k = number of distinct letters in s. If s[0] is a letter L (so L in letters set). Then among the k letters, one is restricted (cannot be 0). So count = (number of assignments where L != 0). Let's denote m = k. For unrestricted, total assignments = P(10, m) = 10 * 9 * ... * (10 - m + 1) = 10!/(10-m)!. If there is a restricted letter, we need to count assignments where that letter gets digit from 1..9 (i.e., 9 choices) and then the remaining (m-1) letters get distinct digits from the remaining 9 digits (including possibly 0), i.e., 9 * P(9, m-1). Let's verify: pick a digit for L from 1..9 (9 options). Then for each of remaining m-1 letters, assign distinct digits from the remaining 9 digits (0 plus the other 8 non-zero digits not chosen for L). That's 9 * 8 * ... * (9 - (m-1) + 1) = 9 * P(9, m-1) = 9 * (9!/(9-(m-1))! ) = 9 * (9!/(10-m)!). Equivalent to 9 * 9P(m-1) where n=9 and r=m-1. That can also be expressed as (9 * 9!)/(10-m)! = (9! *9)/(10-m)!.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute directly: for m letters, with one special, count = 9 * (9 * 8 * ... * (11 - m) ), if m>=2, else if m=1 then just 9 (choose any digit 1-9). That matches.\n\nIf there is no restricted letter, total assignments = P(10, m).\n\nSo we just need to compute these factorial/permutation values.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- If any letter appears at position 0, and also a '?' appears also at position 0? No, first character cannot be both.\n\n- If s[0] is a letter but also appears elsewhere where there is a '?'? No.\n\n- Check for impossible mapping due to leading zero constraint: e.g., s[0] is letter L and there are >9 distinct letters? Actually maximum distinct letters is 10. If there are 10 distinct letters and one is restricted (cannot be zero), but we need assign 10 distinct digits to 10 letters. If restricted letter cannot be zero, we still can assign zero to the other 9 letters, so total assignments = 9 (choice for restricted letter) * P(9,9) = 9 * 9! = 9*362880 = 3265920. That's feasible. If there are 10 distinct letters and no restricted letter (i.e., first char not letter), total assignments = 10! = 3628800. So both okay.\n\n- If there is also a digit at first char that's 0? Input guarantee says first character != '0', but could be any digit 1-9, or letter or '?', as per guarantee.\n\n- Edge Cases: There might be letters that appear at positions where there is a digit in hint? Actually if s[i] is a digit, that's just fixed digit. That does not affect letter mapping except for the constraint that if letter also appears at another position where hint is digit (like cannot be). So fine.\n\nNow we need to count possible codes matching hint: total = (letter assignments count) * (factor for '?') * (if s[0] != '?' then factor maybe something else? Actually we accounted for leading '?' factor separate; if s[0] is a digit, factor is 1; if s[0] is a letter, factor is 1 as well because mapping handles that; if s[0] is '?', we need factor = 9; else for non-leading '?' we have factor =10.\n\nThus compute:\n\ncnt_q = number of '?' in s.\n\nIf s[0] == '?': q_factor = 9 * (10**(cnt_q - 1))\nelse: q_factor = 10**cnt_q\n\nNow letter_assign_factor:\n\n- Determine distinct letters set: letters_set = set(c for c in s if 'A' <= c <= 'J')\n- k = len(letters_set)\n- If s[0] is a letter, then restricted = True else False\n\nIf restricted:\n    if k == 0: (But can't be because s[0] is a letter, so at least that letter)\n    else: letter_assign_factor = 9 * P(9, k-1)\nElse:\n    letter_assign_factor = P(10, k)\n\nCheck for possible conflict: any letter may be forced by being at same position as a digit? Not possible. So no conflict.\n\nBut we must also consider case where s[0] is letter and also there is a '?' anywhere else. The '?' factor multiplies.\n\nPotential pitfalls: leading zero also matters for mapping if letter appears at first position and also appears somewhere else where there is a digit that may be 0? Actually if letter appears at first position, it cannot be zero because the number cannot start with zero. The other occurrence of same letter does not impose extra constraints on zero. So mapping is fine.\n\nNow we must produce final answer as integer printed.\n\nLet's test with sample:\n\nInput: \"AJ\". s[0] = 'A', not '?', no '?' marks. letters_set = {'A','B' maybe 'J'?). Actually string \"AJ\": first char 'A', second 'J'. letters_set = {'A','J'}, k=2. s[0] is letter A, restricted = True. letter_assign_factor = 9 * P(9, 1) = 9*9=81. No '?' so factor=1. total =81. matches sample output 81.\n\nSecond sample: \"1?AA\". s[0] = '1', not '?' (so no leading restriction). letters_set = {'A'} (just 'A'), k=1. restricted = False because s[0] not a letter. letter_assign_factor = P(10,1) = 10. cnt_q = 1 (position 1). factor for '?' = 10 (since not at first). total = 10 * 10 = 100. matches sample.\n\nWorks.\n\nNow think about more edge cases.\n\nConsider s = \"?\". n=1, cnt_q=1, s[0]=='?'. factor_q = 9 * 10**0 = 9. letters_set empty => factor_letter=1. total=9. Indeed only digits 1-9, no leading zero.\n\nConsider s = \"A\". first char letter 'A', no '?', letters_set = {'A'}, k=1, restricted=True => letter_assign_factor = 9 (choice any digit 1-9). total=9. Indeed safe code must be single digit non-zero, which matches letters mapping: letter A can be assigned any digit 1-9 (cannot be zero). Good.\n\nConsider s = \"0\". first char is digit '0'? But guarantee says first char != '0', so this input cannot occur. However safe code cannot have leading zero. However maybe s could start with digit 0? But guarantee says first char does not equal to character '0'. So not need to handle.\n\nConsider s = \"AB\". first char letter A restricted, letters_set size=2. Factor =9*P(9,1)=9*9=81. No '?'. Indeed mapping: A can be 1-9 (9 options), B can be any digit except A's digit (including 0 if not used). So 9*9=81.\n\nConsider s = \"A?B\". first char letter A (restricted). letters_set = {'A','B'}, k=2. Factor_letter =9*P(9,1)=9*9=81. cnt_q=1, s[0]!='?' so factor_q = 10. total =810. Let's manually compute: assign A digit non-zero, B digit distinct from A. So A 9 options. B 9 options (since among remaining digits, zero possible if A not zero). For '?' at pos1 (index 1): any digit 0-9 =>10. So total 9*9*10=810. Good.\n\nConsider s = \"?A\". first char '?', cnt_q=1, factor_q=9 (since leading). letters_set = {'A'}, k=1, s[0] not letter (so restricted=False). factor_letter =10 (choose any digit for A). total=9*10=90. Let's reason: leading position cannot be 0 => 9 choices. Then '?' is first? Actually '?' is at position0, factor 9. Then A can be any digit 0-9, including 0. So 9*10=90.\n\nNow consider s = \"0A\". This is invalid because first char is '0', but guarantee says not.\n\nNow consider s = \"A0\". first char letter A restricted. letters_set = {'A'}, k=1, restricted = True, factor=9. cnt_q=0. So total=9. Indeed number two-digit code where first digit is A non-zero, second digit is fixed 0. So 9 possibilities.\n\nConsider s = \"?A??\" with leading '?', cnt_q=3, factor_q=9*10^2 = 9*100=900. letters_set={'A'}, factor_letter=10. total=9000. Let's check: leading digit 9 options; the '?' at pos1 can be any 0-9, '?' at pos2, pos3 also any; A can be any 0-9 (10). So 9*10*10*10*10 = 9*10^4 = 90000? Wait compute: 9 *10^4 = 90000, but we have only two extra '?' after leading '?': Actually \"?A??\" => positions: 0 '?', 1 'A', 2 '?', 3 '?'. So total: leading '?' => 9; two other '?' => each 10 => 9*10*10 = 900; times A's 10 => 9000. So matches.\n\nNow a tricky case: s contains letters that appear only in positions that are '?'? Actually if s[i] is a letter, that's not a '?', so fixed.\n\nPotential case: s = \"?AB\". leading '?' => factor_q=9. letters_set={'A','B'}, k=2, restricted=False (since first char not letter). factor_letter = P(10,2) = 10*9=90. total=9*90=810. Let's compute manually: leading digit cannot be 0 => 9 options; A and B must be distinct from each other (and from other digits if needed). So mapping: choose digit for A: any of 0-9 (10); then B must be distinct from A: 9 options; so total mapping for letters = 10*9 = 90. So 9*90=810. Works.\n\nNow think about scenario where letters_set includes the letter at position 0 that is also present elsewhere. It's handled.\n\nNow consider scenario where there are 10 letters (max) and one letter appears at leading position. Then k=10. For restricted case: factor_letter = 9 * P(9,9) = 9 * 9! = 9 * 362880 = 3265920. For non-restricted case: factor_letter = 10! = 3628800. Slightly less due to restriction.\n\nNow we need to compute these factorial/permutation values for up to k <= 10 (or maybe up to 10 letters; we also need to compute 10**cnt_q possibly large exponent). So computing pow(10, cnt_q) can be done via Python's pow with exponent large integer.\n\nNow careful about leading zero for '?' case: if s[0] == '?', we consider cnt_q includes that '?'. So factor_q = 9 * 10**(cnt_q-1). That's fine.\n\nBut if s[0] is '?', and there are also other letters that appear later. The letter assignments are counted independent of '?' factor. However, there's a subtle situation: suppose there is a letter L that appears at position i >0; if that letter is assigned digit 0, it's okay because it's not leading. So our formula for letter assignments doesn't include any restriction on zero for letters other than leading letter.\n\nAll correct.\n\nNow we need to ensure we correctly compute letter_assign_factor for any k (including 0). For k=0 (no letters) we have factor = 1 (empty mapping). If s[0] is letter (but then k>=1). So treat k=0 separately.\n\nNow we need to watch for potential overflow: Python ints are fine.\n\nNow we need to implement reading input. Input spec: first line contains string s. That's it. Only one line. Sample input had two lines? Actually sample inputs are shown as ['AJ', '1?AA'] and sample outputs ['81', '100']. Possibly they illustrate multiple test cases but problem expects single test case.\n\nBut typical codeforces tasks have single test case. So we will just read a line and output answer.\n\nNow think about possible multi-test reading: The description says \"Take input from: standard input. Give output to: standard output. Note: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using input() function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\" That is typical instruction for problem solving on some platform. They want a function that returns answer. We'll just implement solve() reading input.\n\nNow test with various random patterns.\n\nNow we must verify edge cases for patterns with repeated letters and '?', ensure our method counts correctly. Also need to ensure we treat '0's in digits positions correctly: they are fixed digits, no effect on letter assignments except possibly leading zero (the leading digit being 0 is disallowed). Since guarantee ensures s[0] != '0', if s[0] is digit '0', it's impossible? Actually guarantee says first character is not '0', so not happen.\n\nNow need to double-check the requirement that safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. So it's about entire code, not just the first character? Actually leading zeroes means the first digit cannot be zero; other digits can be zero. So our handling is correct.\n\nNow also there is a constraint that string s consists of characters ?, digits 0-9, letters A-J. So only 0-9 digits. Good.\n\nNow about letter mapping distinctness: all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits, positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. So letters must map to distinct digits. Also letters cannot map to same digit as any digit fixed? Actually letters can map to any digit (0-9), not restricted by other fixed digits, because they are not letters; they just must be distinct among themselves. There's no constraint that letters cannot match a fixed digit that's already present elsewhere (i.e., a digit position). For example pattern \"A2\": letter A could be mapped to digit 2, resulting code \"22\"? That would have same digit 2 for both positions, allowed because the first position is letter A, second is digit 2; letter mapping can equal digit 2. That's okay because only distinctness among letters matters, not relative to fixed digits. So okay.\n\nNow check potential issues if a letter appears at a position that is also fixed digit? Not possible.\n\nThus solution approach seems straightforward.\n\nNow let's think about verifying this logic with some random small strings by brute force enumeration to ensure correctness. For n <= maybe 6 or 7 we can brute all possible assignments for letters and '?' to validate.\n\nWe'll code a brute check to test random patterns.\n\nWe'll also need to ensure we compute letter_assign_factor correctly for k letters and a restricted letter.\n\nCompute P(10, k) = product(10 - i for i in range(k)). Or from math.perm.\n\nWe'll implement perm = 1; for i in range(k): perm *= (10 - i). Similarly for restricted case: if restricted: if k==0? Not needed; else: perm * 9 * perm9 where perm9 = product(9 - i for i in range(k-1)). Equivalent to perm = 9 * (9 * 8 * ... * (10 - k)). So we can compute as: if k>0 and restricted: perm = 9 * product(9 - i for i in range(k-1)). If k=0 and restricted? Not possible.\n\nNow the factor for '?' is 10**cnt_q (or 9*10**(cnt_q-1) if s[0]=='?'). Then total = factor_letter * factor_q.\n\nNow check if there is any letter that appears in position 0 but also there is a fixed digit 0 elsewhere, which might conflict with distinctness? It doesn't conflict.\n\nNow is there any scenario where the restricted letter must be distinct from the digit assigned to any '?'? No, '?' digits are independent.\n\nNow test on random small patterns.\n\nWill implement a brute check after solution for small length <= maybe 6.\n\nNow memory/time constraints: O(n) scanning string.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- string may have length up to 100k, but operations O(n) fine.\n\n- The answer could be extremely large, but Python can handle.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Python's pow with big exponent may be okay; use pow(10, cnt_q, no modulus) returns big int.\n\nNow we need to produce final answer as integer.\n\nNow consider sample test with \"A?J\" first char A -> restricted True. letters = {A,J} k=2 => factor_letter=9 * P(9,1)=9*9=81. cnt_q=1 => factor_q = 10. total =810. Let's test manually:\n\n- A can't be 0: 9 choices.\n- J distinct from A: 9 choices (including zero if A not zero).\n- '?' at position 1: 10 options.\nThus 9*9*10=810, matches.\n\nNow consider \"?\" plus letters: \"?\". factor_q=9. letters none => total=9.\n\nNow consider \"A\". factor_letter=9. total=9.\n\nNow consider \"?\". Already good.\n\nNow consider pattern \"A?J?\" where leading letter A. letters: A,J => k=2 => factor_letter=9*P(9,1)=81. cnt_q=2 (two '?' positions), s[0]!='?' => factor_q = 10**2 =100. total = 8100.\n\nManual: A 9, J 9, '?' each 10 => 9*9*10*10 = 8100.\n\nNow consider pattern \"?A?B?\" with leading '?' so factor_q=9*10^4 = 9*10000 =90000. letters A and B distinct: factor_letter=P(10,2)=10*9=90. total=9*10000*90=9*900000=8,100,000? Wait 90*10000=900000; times 9=8,100,000. Let's calculate: factor_q=9*10^4 = 9 * 10000 = 90000. Multiply by 90 = 8,100,000. So answer: 8,100,000. Could be correct.\n\nNow check scenario where some letters appear but also there are some fixed digits that are not zero but also appear at positions where the letter could be mapped to that same digit, causing maybe no extra restrictions. So still fine.\n\nNow we must output as integer.\n\nNow think about potential integer overflow when using pow(10, cnt_q). For cnt_q up to 100k, pow returns integer with 100001 digits. That's fine.\n\nNow we need to produce a solution with correct handling.\n\nNow potential hidden trap: letters are distinct if they appear in the string but may be used zero times? No.\n\nNow the problem might be from Codeforces Round #110? Actually known problem \"C. Safe Code\"? I'm not certain.\n\nAnyway, solution seems correct.\n\nLet's test with random brute:\n\nWe'll write a quick script to generate random strings length up to say 6, with characters from allowed set, ensuring first char not '0', then compute answer using our method and brute enumeration for all possible assignments (choose digits 0-9 for each '?', assign letters mapping to distinct digits, ensure first digit non-zero, and evaluate code). Count matches. Ensure all good.\n\nWe'll incorporate that in analysis (not in final code). We'll simulate mental or using Python if possible offline? Let's simulate in my head, but better to trust. However we can reason to avoid mistakes.\n\nPotential nuance: The hint string contains digits and letters, but the letters constraints require distinct digits for distinct letters. However, they also require that if there are letters that appear only in positions where the hint has a fixed digit, there are no conflict. So it's fine.\n\nNow consider pattern \"AA\". Leading letter A, k=1, restricted true => factor_letter=9. No '?', total=9. Indeed mapping A can be any digit 1-9.\n\nNow pattern \"AA?\" leading letter A restricted true, k=1, factor_letter=9. cnt_q=1 => factor_q=10. total=90.\n\nNow pattern \"?A?\" leading '?' => factor_q=9*10^1 = 9*10=90. letters set {'A'}, k=1, unrestricted => factor_letter = 10. total=900. Let's think manually: leading digit cannot be zero: 9 options; '?' at pos2: any 0-9 (10); letter A any 0-9 (10). So total 9*10*10=900. Good.\n\nNow pattern \"??\": both '?', first '?' not allowed zero => factor_q=9*10^1 = 9*10 = 90 (since one '?' is at position0, another at position1). So answer 90 (i.e., 9*10). Check manually: first digit 1-9 (9); second digit 0-9 (10) => 90. Good.\n\nNow pattern \"?\": answer 9.\n\nNow pattern \"?\" repeated many times leads to 9*10^(n-1) => first digit can't be zero.\n\nNow pattern containing letters and digits: \"AB0\". Leading letter A restricted; letters A,B k=2, factor_letter = 9*9=81; no '?' => total =81. Manual: A cannot be zero => 9 options; B can be any digit distinct from A: 9 options; the third digit fixed 0. So 81.\n\nNow pattern \"A0B\": leading letter A => factor_letter=9*9=81; total 81.\n\nNow pattern \"0AB\": Not allowed because first char '0'.\n\nNow pattern \"??A\": first '?' not zero => factor_q=9*10=90; letters set = {A}, factor_letter=10; total=900. Manual: positions: 0 '?' 1..9 =>9; 1 '?' any 0..9 =>10; A any 0..9 =>10 =>9*10*10=900.\n\nNow pattern \"A??B\". leading letter A, factor_letter=9*9=81; cnt_q=2 => factor_q = 10**2 =100; total=8100.\n\nNow pattern \"A?B?C?D?E?F?G?H?I?J?\"? That's 11 letters? But only up to 10 distinct letters. So not possible. Could be letters repeated.\n\nNow consider pattern \"A\" repeated many times: e.g., s = \"AAAA\". Then letters_set size=1, restricted true (since first char A). factor_letter=9. cnt_q=0. So total=9. Indeed code like \"1111\", \"2222\", ..., \"9999\".\n\nNow pattern \"A?A?A?\" etc.\n\nNow overall solution seems right.\n\nNow potential edge case: first char is digit '0'? The problem guarantee says first char not equal to character '0', so safe.\n\nNow also note that there might be hidden subtlety: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. Additionally, the hint may have leading character '?' but also other digits, letters. That's covered.\n\nNow we must implement solve() reading a line maybe strip newline.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Input may have trailing newline or spaces. We'll use input().strip().\n\nNow output answer as integer without any extra formatting.\n\nNow think about large test: s length 1e5, with all '?' characters. Then cnt_q = 1e5, factor_q = 9 * 10^(1e5-1). That's massive integer with ~1e5 digits. Python can compute pow(10, 99999) quickly. That's okay.\n\nNow memory: storing integer of ~100k digits => 40KB. Acceptable.\n\nNow we need to ensure we don't compute pow(10, cnt_q) if cnt_q is huge? It's okay.\n\nNow time: exponentiation pow of large integer uses exponentiation algorithm O(log exponent) multiplication of large integers. So maybe O(M(log exponent) * cost multiplication). But 10**(100k) is essentially building big integer by repeated multiplication. Python's built-in pow probably uses exponentiation by squaring with large numbers; for exponent 100k, maybe repeated multiplication; but it's okay for 1 second? Possibly slower but likely okay because Python's built-in pow for integers uses exponentiation by repeated squaring and multiplication of big integers of size ~1e5 bits each. Complexity O(M(N) log exponent) where M(N) is multiplication cost for N-bit numbers. For large exponent, total time might be high. But we can compute 10**cnt_q via int('1' + '0'*cnt_q) maybe slower.\n\nBut we can compute product of 10 for each '?' using multiplication in a loop? That's O(cnt_q) multiplication, each multiplication of big integer by 10 (which is cheap) because multiplying by 10 is just shift. Actually multiplying a big integer by 10 can be done quickly as addition? Multiplying by small int is linear in number of machine words. So we can compute q_factor by starting with 1 and for each '?' multiply by 10, and if first char '?' we later adjust by dividing by 10 and multiplying by 9 (or multiply by 9). Or easier: compute q_factor = 10**cnt_q, then if first char '?'"], "responses": ["<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: given a string s composed of characters:\n\n- '?' which is a wildcard digit can be any 0-9 (including leading? but we have condition that first character of string s doesn't equal to character '0' (i.e., the safe code has no leading zeros; also the safe code has no leading zeros overall). The condition is: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. So the first digit cannot be zero. The hint's first character s[0] is not '0' (as per input guarantee). So we have to enforce that for possible codes, the first digit must be non-zero. This constraint will affect counts when s[0] is '?' or a letter assigned to the first position, etc. Also for letters, they must be assigned distinct digits 0-9, each letter A-J is distinct variable.\n\n- digits '0'..'9' which is fixed digit.\n\n- letters 'A'..'J', with constraints: same letter => same digit; different letters => distinct digits.\n\nGoal: count number of possible safe codes satisfying hint and also have no leading zero (i.e., first digit cannot be zero). Count up to large numbers; answer may be huge (up to 10^?), but we need to output the integer count (presumably fits in 64-bit? Possibly larger). But given |s| up to 100k, counts may be huge (10^(100k)!). But likely we need to output number modulo something? The problem statement says just print the number. However typical Codeforces style problem (#???). Let's search memory: There is a known problem \"C. Codeforces Round #...\" where they ask to count number of possible numbers matching pattern with letters, digits, and ?. There's a known problem: \"Special Agent Smart Beaver\" maybe from some contest. The output may be a huge number that may need big integer printing. Python can handle arbitrary large integer. So we can just compute combinatorial count using Python big ints. But careful: for length up to 1e5, the number could be monstrous (10^(1e5)). Python's big integer memory consumption would be huge if we compute power huge numbers directly? But maybe the pattern reduces possibilities drastically because letters restrict distinct digits, leading to at most 10! * ... combos. Actually letters up to 10 distinct letters, each must be a distinct digit 0-9. So maximum number of distinct letters is <=10. So the factor for letters assignment is at most 10P (permutations of digits of size k). That's bounded by 10! = 3628800. Then for '?' positions each gives factor up to 10. So overall count <= 10! * 10^#question. For N up to 100k, could be 10^(#question) huge, but Python can store integer with arbitrary length; it would have about (#question) * log10(10) = #question decimal digits. If #question is 100k, that's 100k digits, which is large but Python can handle storing a 100k-digit integer? Possibly memory ~ 100k bytes ~ 100KB. Actually Python's big ints store binary; each digit is 30 bits (or 15 bits). So 100k decimal digits = about log2(10)*100k \u2248 332k bits ~ 42KB. That's fine. But computing 10**100k might produce huge integer? 10**100k is a huge integer with 100001 digits (1 followed by 100k zeros). That's also ~ 50KB memory. So okay.\n\nBut we need to handle multiplications of such large numbers maybe 10! * 10^k. That's similar magnitude. So we can compute count as integer using Python's pow and multiplication.\n\nPotential nuance: leading zero restriction. The safe code has no leading zeroes overall; i.e., the first digit cannot be zero. Given the hint's first character is not '0', but could be '?', 'A'-'J', or a digit 1-9. If it's '?' we must only consider digits 1-9 (9 possibilities) for the first position (since 0 not allowed). If it's a letter, that letter's assigned digit cannot be zero. If it's a digit, it's fixed to that digit, and we just accept. If it's any other symbol? only those.\n\nSo we need to count assignments to letters A-J that assign distinct digits 0-9, satisfying restrictions like:\n\n- If a letter appears at position 0 (first character), its assigned digit cannot be 0 (to avoid leading zero). Actually that is requirement for whole number: the first digit cannot be zero. So if the first character is a letter, the assigned digit must be non-zero. If it's '?' we restrict to digits 1-9. If it's a digit, we must ensure it's non-zero: input guarantee ensures it's not '0', but digits 0 appear in other positions permitted.\n\nThus the count for assignments to letters also depends on which letters appear at first position (maybe more than one letter appears: but if a letter appears at multiple positions, the same digit across all those positions). For any letter that appears at first position, its digit cannot be zero; other letters that do not appear at first position can be zero as long as distinctness is satisfied.\n\nThus the counting approach: We have at most 10 distinct letters. Let k = number of distinct letters. There may be some letters that appear at the first position (if s[0] is letter). Because there is only one first position, it can be at most one distinct letter that appears there, i.e., either s[0] is a letter or not. So if s[0] is letter X, then X cannot be assigned digit 0. Otherwise, there is no restriction on letter assignments regarding zero.\n\nBut also note that if any letter appears at any position that has a fixed digit (like letter 'A' appears where s[i] is digit 5), then the assigned digit for A must be 5. So that imposes constraints on assignments.\n\nThus we need to handle constraints: For each letter, if there is a position where s[i] is a digit, that letter must map to that digit. If there are conflicting digits for same letter (multiple digits), then no possible assignments => answer is 0.\n\nAlso letters may have constraints that they cannot be 0 if they appear in leading position, but also they might be forced to a certain digit >0, which is fine. So we need to count the number of injective maps from letters to digits 0-9 satisfying constraints, with the extra restriction that if letter appears at leading position, its digit !=0.\n\nThen for each '?' we multiply by 10 (or 9 for the first position's '?'), unless there is a letter at that position? Actually if s[i] = '?', then the digit at i can be any 0-9, independent of others, except for leading constraint. So each '?' multiplies by 10, except if i=0 multiply by 9.\n\nIf s[i] is a fixed digit, no multiplication factor.\n\nIf s[i] is a letter, it's part of mapping constraints; after we choose mapping for letters, those positions are fixed to that digit. So no further multiplication factor for those positions beyond the mapping.\n\nThus the answer = (number of valid assignments of letters) * (10^(#question marks not at position 0)) * (9 if s[0] == '?' else 1).\n\nBut need to be careful if leading character is a letter, mapping for that letter must be non-zero, which reduces assignment count from full permutations of k letters (choose distinct digits for each) to permutations where that specific letter is not assigned digit 0. So we need to compute number of assignments of letters to digits with constraints (some letters have predetermined digits due to occurrences of digit positions; one letter may be forced to a digit that could be 0 or non-zero). The constraints might involve multiple letters: e.g., pattern \"AA0\"? Actually '0' is a digit. Suppose pattern \"A0A\". Then letter 'A' occurs at pos 0 and pos 2; position 1 is digit '0'. Since pos0 is first digit, 'A' cannot be 0 (but that would contradict the occurrence of '0' at pos1; it's a different position; but if 'A' appears elsewhere with digit 0, that is okay because the other position can be zero as long as first digit isn't zero. So only constraint is for first position.\n\nThus algorithm steps:\n\n1. Input string s.\n2. Let n = len(s).\n3. Count positions:\n   - question marks: count_q; if s[0] == '?' then answer_q_factor = 9 else answer_q_factor = 1 (for leading).\n   But careful: If s[0] == '?' we multiply later: base factor for leading question mark is 9 (instead of 10). So compute pow10 = 10**(cnt_q - (1 if s[0]=='?' else 0)) (if cnt_q >0). Then final factor = pow10 * (9 if s[0]=='?' else 1). Actually we can simply compute total_q_factor = (9 if s[0]=='?' else 1) * (10**cnt_q_nolead). This is same.\n\n4. Determine letters and constraints:\n   - Use arrays:\n      forced_digit[letter] = -1 initially (unknown). -2 for conflict or assigned.\n   - For each position i:\n        if s[i] is letter c:\n           letter_idx = ord(c)-ord('A')\n        else ignore.\n\n   - For each position i where s[i] is digit d:\n        If s[i] is digit and also letter? Actually digits are not letters; ignore letters at digit positions.\n   - For each position i where s[i] is digit and next char is letter? Actually not needed.\n\n   - If we encounter a digit position, that's just a fixed digit; that doesn't affect mapping.\n\n   - For letters constraints: we must check any fixed digit constraints:\n        For each position i where s[i] is letter, if there exists some other position j (maybe same i) where s[j] is a digit and the same letter appears at position i? Actually not; the digits are independent.\n\n   But there may also be constraints where the same letter appears in multiple positions, all must have same digit. That's automatically satisfied by mapping, no conflict.\n\n   However there might be constraints where a letter appears in position where a digit is forced? No, that can't happen: digits are fixed digits, not letters.\n\n   However there could be constraints where a letter appears at position i, and at position j (maybe same letter) the hint contains a digit (maybe same letter? No, digits are separate). The constraints are only about same letters mapping to same digit; there is no \"letter equal digit\" constraint. So only mapping constraints are that letters must map to distinct digits, each to a digit 0-9; no digit constraints. So there is no forced mapping for letters (except the leading zero constraint). Right.\n\n   So the only constraints for letter assignment are:\n      - Different letters must have different digits.\n      - Up to 10 distinct letters.\n      - If a letter appears at position 0 (i.e., s[0] is letter), that digit cannot be zero.\n\nThus the count for assignments is: number of injective maps from k letters to digits 0..9, such that if there is a \"restricted\" letter R (first position letter), its assigned digit != 0. If there is no restricted letter (i.e., s[0] is not a letter), then no restriction.\n\nBut we need also to consider letters that appear in first position and are also the only occurrence? That is just the same as restricted.\n\nSo let k = number of distinct letters in s. If s[0] is a letter L (so L in letters set). Then among the k letters, one is restricted (cannot be 0). So count = (number of assignments where L != 0). Let's denote m = k. For unrestricted, total assignments = P(10, m) = 10 * 9 * ... * (10 - m + 1) = 10!/(10-m)!. If there is a restricted letter, we need to count assignments where that letter gets digit from 1..9 (i.e., 9 choices) and then the remaining (m-1) letters get distinct digits from the remaining 9 digits (including possibly 0), i.e., 9 * P(9, m-1). Let's verify: pick a digit for L from 1..9 (9 options). Then for each of remaining m-1 letters, assign distinct digits from the remaining 9 digits (0 plus the other 8 non-zero digits not chosen for L). That's 9 * 8 * ... * (9 - (m-1) + 1) = 9 * P(9, m-1) = 9 * (9!/(9-(m-1))! ) = 9 * (9!/(10-m)!). Equivalent to 9 * 9P(m-1) where n=9 and r=m-1. That can also be expressed as (9 * 9!)/(10-m)! = (9! *9)/(10-m)!.\n\nAlternatively, we can compute directly: for m letters, with one special, count = 9 * (9 * 8 * ... * (11 - m) ), if m>=2, else if m=1 then just 9 (choose any digit 1-9). That matches.\n\nIf there is no restricted letter, total assignments = P(10, m).\n\nSo we just need to compute these factorial/permutation values.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- If any letter appears at position 0, and also a '?' appears also at position 0? No, first character cannot be both.\n\n- If s[0] is a letter but also appears elsewhere where there is a '?'? No.\n\n- Check for impossible mapping due to leading zero constraint: e.g., s[0] is letter L and there are >9 distinct letters? Actually maximum distinct letters is 10. If there are 10 distinct letters and one is restricted (cannot be zero), but we need assign 10 distinct digits to 10 letters. If restricted letter cannot be zero, we still can assign zero to the other 9 letters, so total assignments = 9 (choice for restricted letter) * P(9,9) = 9 * 9! = 9*362880 = 3265920. That's feasible. If there are 10 distinct letters and no restricted letter (i.e., first char not letter), total assignments = 10! = 3628800. So both okay.\n\n- If there is also a digit at first char that's 0? Input guarantee says first character != '0', but could be any digit 1-9, or letter or '?', as per guarantee.\n\n- Edge Cases: There might be letters that appear at positions where there is a digit in hint? Actually if s[i] is a digit, that's just fixed digit. That does not affect letter mapping except for the constraint that if letter also appears at another position where hint is digit (like cannot be). So fine.\n\nNow we need to count possible codes matching hint: total = (letter assignments count) * (factor for '?') * (if s[0] != '?' then factor maybe something else? Actually we accounted for leading '?' factor separate; if s[0] is a digit, factor is 1; if s[0] is a letter, factor is 1 as well because mapping handles that; if s[0] is '?', we need factor = 9; else for non-leading '?' we have factor =10.\n\nThus compute:\n\ncnt_q = number of '?' in s.\n\nIf s[0] == '?': q_factor = 9 * (10**(cnt_q - 1))\nelse: q_factor = 10**cnt_q\n\nNow letter_assign_factor:\n\n- Determine distinct letters set: letters_set = set(c for c in s if 'A' <= c <= 'J')\n- k = len(letters_set)\n- If s[0] is a letter, then restricted = True else False\n\nIf restricted:\n    if k == 0: (But can't be because s[0] is a letter, so at least that letter)\n    else: letter_assign_factor = 9 * P(9, k-1)\nElse:\n    letter_assign_factor = P(10, k)\n\nCheck for possible conflict: any letter may be forced by being at same position as a digit? Not possible. So no conflict.\n\nBut we must also consider case where s[0] is letter and also there is a '?' anywhere else. The '?' factor multiplies.\n\nPotential pitfalls: leading zero also matters for mapping if letter appears at first position and also appears somewhere else where there is a digit that may be 0? Actually if letter appears at first position, it cannot be zero because the number cannot start with zero. The other occurrence of same letter does not impose extra constraints on zero. So mapping is fine.\n\nNow we must produce final answer as integer printed.\n\nLet's test with sample:\n\nInput: \"AJ\". s[0] = 'A', not '?', no '?' marks. letters_set = {'A','B' maybe 'J'?). Actually string \"AJ\": first char 'A', second 'J'. letters_set = {'A','J'}, k=2. s[0] is letter A, restricted = True. letter_assign_factor = 9 * P(9, 1) = 9*9=81. No '?' so factor=1. total =81. matches sample output 81.\n\nSecond sample: \"1?AA\". s[0] = '1', not '?' (so no leading restriction). letters_set = {'A'} (just 'A'), k=1. restricted = False because s[0] not a letter. letter_assign_factor = P(10,1) = 10. cnt_q = 1 (position 1). factor for '?' = 10 (since not at first). total = 10 * 10 = 100. matches sample.\n\nWorks.\n\nNow think about more edge cases.\n\nConsider s = \"?\". n=1, cnt_q=1, s[0]=='?'. factor_q = 9 * 10**0 = 9. letters_set empty => factor_letter=1. total=9. Indeed only digits 1-9, no leading zero.\n\nConsider s = \"A\". first char letter 'A', no '?', letters_set = {'A'}, k=1, restricted=True => letter_assign_factor = 9 (choice any digit 1-9). total=9. Indeed safe code must be single digit non-zero, which matches letters mapping: letter A can be assigned any digit 1-9 (cannot be zero). Good.\n\nConsider s = \"0\". first char is digit '0'? But guarantee says first char != '0', so this input cannot occur. However safe code cannot have leading zero. However maybe s could start with digit 0? But guarantee says first char does not equal to character '0'. So not need to handle.\n\nConsider s = \"AB\". first char letter A restricted, letters_set size=2. Factor =9*P(9,1)=9*9=81. No '?'. Indeed mapping: A can be 1-9 (9 options), B can be any digit except A's digit (including 0 if not used). So 9*9=81.\n\nConsider s = \"A?B\". first char letter A (restricted). letters_set = {'A','B'}, k=2. Factor_letter =9*P(9,1)=9*9=81. cnt_q=1, s[0]!='?' so factor_q = 10. total =810. Let's manually compute: assign A digit non-zero, B digit distinct from A. So A 9 options. B 9 options (since among remaining digits, zero possible if A not zero). For '?' at pos1 (index 1): any digit 0-9 =>10. So total 9*9*10=810. Good.\n\nConsider s = \"?A\". first char '?', cnt_q=1, factor_q=9 (since leading). letters_set = {'A'}, k=1, s[0] not letter (so restricted=False). factor_letter =10 (choose any digit for A). total=9*10=90. Let's reason: leading position cannot be 0 => 9 choices. Then '?' is first? Actually '?' is at position0, factor 9. Then A can be any digit 0-9, including 0. So 9*10=90.\n\nNow consider s = \"0A\". This is invalid because first char is '0', but guarantee says not.\n\nNow consider s = \"A0\". first char letter A restricted. letters_set = {'A'}, k=1, restricted = True, factor=9. cnt_q=0. So total=9. Indeed number two-digit code where first digit is A non-zero, second digit is fixed 0. So 9 possibilities.\n\nConsider s = \"?A??\" with leading '?', cnt_q=3, factor_q=9*10^2 = 9*100=900. letters_set={'A'}, factor_letter=10. total=9000. Let's check: leading digit 9 options; the '?' at pos1 can be any 0-9, '?' at pos2, pos3 also any; A can be any 0-9 (10). So 9*10*10*10*10 = 9*10^4 = 90000? Wait compute: 9 *10^4 = 90000, but we have only two extra '?' after leading '?': Actually \"?A??\" => positions: 0 '?', 1 'A', 2 '?', 3 '?'. So total: leading '?' => 9; two other '?' => each 10 => 9*10*10 = 900; times A's 10 => 9000. So matches.\n\nNow a tricky case: s contains letters that appear only in positions that are '?'? Actually if s[i] is a letter, that's not a '?', so fixed.\n\nPotential case: s = \"?AB\". leading '?' => factor_q=9. letters_set={'A','B'}, k=2, restricted=False (since first char not letter). factor_letter = P(10,2) = 10*9=90. total=9*90=810. Let's compute manually: leading digit cannot be 0 => 9 options; A and B must be distinct from each other (and from other digits if needed). So mapping: choose digit for A: any of 0-9 (10); then B must be distinct from A: 9 options; so total mapping for letters = 10*9 = 90. So 9*90=810. Works.\n\nNow think about scenario where letters_set includes the letter at position 0 that is also present elsewhere. It's handled.\n\nNow consider scenario where there are 10 letters (max) and one letter appears at leading position. Then k=10. For restricted case: factor_letter = 9 * P(9,9) = 9 * 9! = 9 * 362880 = 3265920. For non-restricted case: factor_letter = 10! = 3628800. Slightly less due to restriction.\n\nNow we need to compute these factorial/permutation values for up to k <= 10 (or maybe up to 10 letters; we also need to compute 10**cnt_q possibly large exponent). So computing pow(10, cnt_q) can be done via Python's pow with exponent large integer.\n\nNow careful about leading zero for '?' case: if s[0] == '?', we consider cnt_q includes that '?'. So factor_q = 9 * 10**(cnt_q-1). That's fine.\n\nBut if s[0] is '?', and there are also other letters that appear later. The letter assignments are counted independent of '?' factor. However, there's a subtle situation: suppose there is a letter L that appears at position i >0; if that letter is assigned digit 0, it's okay because it's not leading. So our formula for letter assignments doesn't include any restriction on zero for letters other than leading letter.\n\nAll correct.\n\nNow we need to ensure we correctly compute letter_assign_factor for any k (including 0). For k=0 (no letters) we have factor = 1 (empty mapping). If s[0] is letter (but then k>=1). So treat k=0 separately.\n\nNow we need to watch for potential overflow: Python ints are fine.\n\nNow we need to implement reading input. Input spec: first line contains string s. That's it. Only one line. Sample input had two lines? Actually sample inputs are shown as ['AJ', '1?AA'] and sample outputs ['81', '100']. Possibly they illustrate multiple test cases but problem expects single test case.\n\nBut typical codeforces tasks have single test case. So we will just read a line and output answer.\n\nNow think about possible multi-test reading: The description says \"Take input from: standard input. Give output to: standard output. Note: If you are writing a function then after the function definition take input from using input() function, call the function with specified parameters and finally print the output of the function.\" That is typical instruction for problem solving on some platform. They want a function that returns answer. We'll just implement solve() reading input.\n\nNow test with various random patterns.\n\nNow we must verify edge cases for patterns with repeated letters and '?', ensure our method counts correctly. Also need to ensure we treat '0's in digits positions correctly: they are fixed digits, no effect on letter assignments except possibly leading zero (the leading digit being 0 is disallowed). Since guarantee ensures s[0] != '0', if s[0] is digit '0', it's impossible? Actually guarantee says first character is not '0', so not happen.\n\nNow need to double-check the requirement that safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. So it's about entire code, not just the first character? Actually leading zeroes means the first digit cannot be zero; other digits can be zero. So our handling is correct.\n\nNow also there is a constraint that string s consists of characters ?, digits 0-9, letters A-J. So only 0-9 digits. Good.\n\nNow about letter mapping distinctness: all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits, positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits. So letters must map to distinct digits. Also letters cannot map to same digit as any digit fixed? Actually letters can map to any digit (0-9), not restricted by other fixed digits, because they are not letters; they just must be distinct among themselves. There's no constraint that letters cannot match a fixed digit that's already present elsewhere (i.e., a digit position). For example pattern \"A2\": letter A could be mapped to digit 2, resulting code \"22\"? That would have same digit 2 for both positions, allowed because the first position is letter A, second is digit 2; letter mapping can equal digit 2. That's okay because only distinctness among letters matters, not relative to fixed digits. So okay.\n\nNow check potential issues if a letter appears at a position that is also fixed digit? Not possible.\n\nThus solution approach seems straightforward.\n\nNow let's think about verifying this logic with some random small strings by brute force enumeration to ensure correctness. For n <= maybe 6 or 7 we can brute all possible assignments for letters and '?' to validate.\n\nWe'll code a brute check to test random patterns.\n\nWe'll also need to ensure we compute letter_assign_factor correctly for k letters and a restricted letter.\n\nCompute P(10, k) = product(10 - i for i in range(k)). Or from math.perm.\n\nWe'll implement perm = 1; for i in range(k): perm *= (10 - i). Similarly for restricted case: if restricted: if k==0? Not needed; else: perm * 9 * perm9 where perm9 = product(9 - i for i in range(k-1)). Equivalent to perm = 9 * (9 * 8 * ... * (10 - k)). So we can compute as: if k>0 and restricted: perm = 9 * product(9 - i for i in range(k-1)). If k=0 and restricted? Not possible.\n\nNow the factor for '?' is 10**cnt_q (or 9*10**(cnt_q-1) if s[0]=='?'). Then total = factor_letter * factor_q.\n\nNow check if there is any letter that appears in position 0 but also there is a fixed digit 0 elsewhere, which might conflict with distinctness? It doesn't conflict.\n\nNow is there any scenario where the restricted letter must be distinct from the digit assigned to any '?'? No, '?' digits are independent.\n\nNow test on random small patterns.\n\nWill implement a brute check after solution for small length <= maybe 6.\n\nNow memory/time constraints: O(n) scanning string.\n\nEdge Cases:\n\n- string may have length up to 100k, but operations O(n) fine.\n\n- The answer could be extremely large, but Python can handle.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Python's pow with big exponent may be okay; use pow(10, cnt_q, no modulus) returns big int.\n\nNow we need to produce final answer as integer.\n\nNow consider sample test with \"A?J\" first char A -> restricted True. letters = {A,J} k=2 => factor_letter=9 * P(9,1)=9*9=81. cnt_q=1 => factor_q = 10. total =810. Let's test manually:\n\n- A can't be 0: 9 choices.\n- J distinct from A: 9 choices (including zero if A not zero).\n- '?' at position 1: 10 options.\nThus 9*9*10=810, matches.\n\nNow consider \"?\" plus letters: \"?\". factor_q=9. letters none => total=9.\n\nNow consider \"A\". factor_letter=9. total=9.\n\nNow consider \"?\". Already good.\n\nNow consider pattern \"A?J?\" where leading letter A. letters: A,J => k=2 => factor_letter=9*P(9,1)=81. cnt_q=2 (two '?' positions), s[0]!='?' => factor_q = 10**2 =100. total = 8100.\n\nManual: A 9, J 9, '?' each 10 => 9*9*10*10 = 8100.\n\nNow consider pattern \"?A?B?\" with leading '?' so factor_q=9*10^4 = 9*10000 =90000. letters A and B distinct: factor_letter=P(10,2)=10*9=90. total=9*10000*90=9*900000=8,100,000? Wait 90*10000=900000; times 9=8,100,000. Let's calculate: factor_q=9*10^4 = 9 * 10000 = 90000. Multiply by 90 = 8,100,000. So answer: 8,100,000. Could be correct.\n\nNow check scenario where some letters appear but also there are some fixed digits that are not zero but also appear at positions where the letter could be mapped to that same digit, causing maybe no extra restrictions. So still fine.\n\nNow we must output as integer.\n\nNow think about potential integer overflow when using pow(10, cnt_q). For cnt_q up to 100k, pow returns integer with 100001 digits. That's fine.\n\nNow we need to produce a solution with correct handling.\n\nNow potential hidden trap: letters are distinct if they appear in the string but may be used zero times? No.\n\nNow the problem might be from Codeforces Round #110? Actually known problem \"C. Safe Code\"? I'm not certain.\n\nAnyway, solution seems correct.\n\nLet's test with random brute:\n\nWe'll write a quick script to generate random strings length up to say 6, with characters from allowed set, ensuring first char not '0', then compute answer using our method and brute enumeration for all possible assignments (choose digits 0-9 for each '?', assign letters mapping to distinct digits, ensure first digit non-zero, and evaluate code). Count matches. Ensure all good.\n\nWe'll incorporate that in analysis (not in final code). We'll simulate mental or using Python if possible offline? Let's simulate in my head, but better to trust. However we can reason to avoid mistakes.\n\nPotential nuance: The hint string contains digits and letters, but the letters constraints require distinct digits for distinct letters. However, they also require that if there are letters that appear only in positions where the hint has a fixed digit, there are no conflict. So it's fine.\n\nNow consider pattern \"AA\". Leading letter A, k=1, restricted true => factor_letter=9. No '?', total=9. Indeed mapping A can be any digit 1-9.\n\nNow pattern \"AA?\" leading letter A restricted true, k=1, factor_letter=9. cnt_q=1 => factor_q=10. total=90.\n\nNow pattern \"?A?\" leading '?' => factor_q=9*10^1 = 9*10=90. letters set {'A'}, k=1, unrestricted => factor_letter = 10. total=900. Let's think manually: leading digit cannot be zero: 9 options; '?' at pos2: any 0-9 (10); letter A any 0-9 (10). So total 9*10*10=900. Good.\n\nNow pattern \"??\": both '?', first '?' not allowed zero => factor_q=9*10^1 = 9*10 = 90 (since one '?' is at position0, another at position1). So answer 90 (i.e., 9*10). Check manually: first digit 1-9 (9); second digit 0-9 (10) => 90. Good.\n\nNow pattern \"?\": answer 9.\n\nNow pattern \"?\" repeated many times leads to 9*10^(n-1) => first digit can't be zero.\n\nNow pattern containing letters and digits: \"AB0\". Leading letter A restricted; letters A,B k=2, factor_letter = 9*9=81; no '?' => total =81. Manual: A cannot be zero => 9 options; B can be any digit distinct from A: 9 options; the third digit fixed 0. So 81.\n\nNow pattern \"A0B\": leading letter A => factor_letter=9*9=81; total 81.\n\nNow pattern \"0AB\": Not allowed because first char '0'.\n\nNow pattern \"??A\": first '?' not zero => factor_q=9*10=90; letters set = {A}, factor_letter=10; total=900. Manual: positions: 0 '?' 1..9 =>9; 1 '?' any 0..9 =>10; A any 0..9 =>10 =>9*10*10=900.\n\nNow pattern \"A??B\". leading letter A, factor_letter=9*9=81; cnt_q=2 => factor_q = 10**2 =100; total=8100.\n\nNow pattern \"A?B?C?D?E?F?G?H?I?J?\"? That's 11 letters? But only up to 10 distinct letters. So not possible. Could be letters repeated.\n\nNow consider pattern \"A\" repeated many times: e.g., s = \"AAAA\". Then letters_set size=1, restricted true (since first char A). factor_letter=9. cnt_q=0. So total=9. Indeed code like \"1111\", \"2222\", ..., \"9999\".\n\nNow pattern \"A?A?A?\" etc.\n\nNow overall solution seems right.\n\nNow potential edge case: first char is digit '0'? The problem guarantee says first char not equal to character '0', so safe.\n\nNow also note that there might be hidden subtlety: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. Additionally, the hint may have leading character '?' but also other digits, letters. That's covered.\n\nNow we must implement solve() reading a line maybe strip newline.\n\nPotential pitfalls: Input may have trailing newline or spaces. We'll use input().strip().\n\nNow output answer as integer without any extra formatting.\n\nNow think about large test: s length 1e5, with all '?' characters. Then cnt_q = 1e5, factor_q = 9 * 10^(1e5-1). That's massive integer with ~1e5 digits. Python can compute pow(10, 99999) quickly. That's okay.\n\nNow memory: storing integer of ~100k digits => 40KB. Acceptable.\n\nNow we need to ensure we don't compute pow(10, cnt_q) if cnt_q is huge? It's okay.\n\nNow time: exponentiation pow of large integer uses exponentiation algorithm O(log exponent) multiplication of large integers. So maybe O(M(log exponent) * cost multiplication). But 10**(100k) is essentially building big integer by repeated multiplication. Python's built-in pow probably uses exponentiation by squaring with large numbers; for exponent 100k, maybe repeated multiplication; but it's okay for 1 second? Possibly slower but likely okay because Python's built-in pow for integers uses exponentiation by repeated squaring and multiplication of big integers of size ~1e5 bits each. Complexity O(M(N) log exponent) where M(N) is multiplication cost for N-bit numbers. For large exponent, total time might be high. But we can compute 10**cnt_q via int('1' + '0'*cnt_q) maybe slower.\n\nBut we can compute product of 10 for each '?' using multiplication in a loop? That's O(cnt_q) multiplication, each multiplication of big integer by 10 (which is cheap) because multiplying by 10 is just shift. Actually multiplying a big integer by 10 can be done quickly as addition? Multiplying by small int is linear in number of machine words. So we can compute q_factor by starting with 1 and for each '?' multiply by 10, and if first char '?' we later adjust by dividing by 10 and multiplying by 9 (or multiply by 9). Or easier: compute q_factor = 10**cnt_q, then if first char '?'"], "prompt_tokens": [0], "completion_tokens": [0], "no_of_try": 1, "api_calls": 8, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "d3c10d1b1a17ad018359e2dab80d2b82"}
