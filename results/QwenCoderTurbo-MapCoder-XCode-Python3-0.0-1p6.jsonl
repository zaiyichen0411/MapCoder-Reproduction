We say that \u03c8(n) is the reflection of n. For example, reflection of 192 equals 807. Note that leading zeros (if any) should be omitted. So reflection of 9 equals 0, reflection of 91 equals 8.Let us call the weight of the number the product of the number and its reflection. Thus, the weight of the number 10 is equal to 10\u00b789\u2009=\u2009890.Your task is to find the maximum weight of the numbers in the given range [l,\u2009r] (boundaries are included).", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "2 seconds", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "Input contains two space-separated integers l and r (1\u2009\u2264\u2009l\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u2009109) \u2014 bounds of the range.", "output_spec": "Output should contain single integer number: maximum value of the product n\u00b7\u03c8(n), where l\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009r.
