We need to check if the string \"hello\" appears as a subsequence in the given string. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of remaining elements.\n\n## Tutorial:\n**Subsequence Matching** is a fundamental concept in string processing and dynamic programming. To check if a pattern string P is a subsequence of a text string T:\n\n1. **Two-pointer approach**: Use one pointer for the pattern and another for the text. Move through the text and whenever we find a character matching the current pattern character, advance the pattern pointer.\n\n2. **Algorithm steps**:\n   - Initialize two pointers: `i` for pattern, `j` for text\n   - Iterate through the text with pointer `j`\n   - When `pattern[i] == text[j]`, increment `i`\n   - If we reach the end of pattern (`i == len(pattern)`), then pattern is a subsequence\n   - If we finish iterating text but haven't matched all pattern characters, it's not a subsequence\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the length of the text string\n**Space Complexity**: O(1)\n\n## Example Problems:\n\n### Problem 1: Is Subsequence (LeetCode 392)\n**Description**: Given two strings s and t, check if s is a subsequence of t.\n**Solution**: Use two pointers. One for s and one for t. Move through t and match characters with s in order.\n```python\ndef isSubsequence(s, t):\n    i = 0  # pointer for s\n    for char in t:\n        if i < len(s) and char == s[i]:\n            i += 1\n    return i == len(s)\n\n# Test\nprint(isSubsequence(\"abc\", \"ahbgdc\"))  # True\nprint(isSubsequence(\"axc\", \"ahbgdc\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)\n**Description**: Find the length of the longest subsequence common to both strings.\n**Solution**: Use dynamic programming where dp[i][j] represents LCS length for first i chars of str1 and first j chars of str2.\n```python\ndef longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):\n    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])\n    \n    return dp[m][n]\n\n# Test\nprint(longestCommonSubsequence(\"abcde\", \"ace\"))  # 3\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Number of Matching Subsequences\n**Description**: Count how many words from a list are subsequences of a given string.\n**Solution**: For each word, check if it's a subsequence using the two-pointer technique.\n```python\ndef numMatchingSubseq(s, words):\n    def isSubsequence(word, s):\n        i = 0\n        for char in s:\n            if i < len(word) and char == word[i]:\n                i += 1\n        return i == len(word)\n    \n    count = 0\n    for word in words:\n        if isSubsequence(word, s):\n            count += 1\n    return count\n\n# Test\nprint(numMatchingSubseq(\"abcde\", [\"a\",\"bb\",\"acd\",\"ace\"]))  # 3\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n### Explanation of the solution:\n1. We need to check if \"hello\" is a subsequence of the input string\n2. Use two pointers approach:\n   - One pointer (`target_index`) for tracking our position in \"hello\"\n   - Another pointer (`i`) for iterating through the input string\n3. For each character in the input string, if it matches the current character we're looking for in \"hello\", we advance the target pointer\n4. If we successfully match all characters of \"hello\", we return \"YES\", otherwise \"NO\"\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    s = input().strip()\n    target = \"hello\"\n    target_index = 0\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the input string\n    for i in range(len(s)):\n        # If we've matched all characters in \"hello\", break early\n        if target_index == len(target):\n            break\n            \n        # If current character matches what we're looking for, advance target_index\n        if s[i] == target[target_index]:\n            target_index += 1\n    \n    # Check if we matched all characters in \"hello\"\n    if target_index == len(target):\n        print(\"YES\")\n    else:\n        print(\"NO\")\n\n# Call the function\nsolve()\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [474], "completion_tokens": [1082], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "c5d19dc8f2478ee8d9cba8cc2e4cd838"}
