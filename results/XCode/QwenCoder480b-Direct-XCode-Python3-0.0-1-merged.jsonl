{"description": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of $$$s$$$ be $$$|s|$$$.

{"description": "The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of $$$n$$$ intersections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection $$$v$$$ to another intersection $$$u$$$ is the path that starts in $$$v$$$, ends in $$$u$$$ and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection $$$s$$$ and works in a building near the intersection $$$t$$$. Every day he gets from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_k$$$, where $$$p_1 = s$$$, $$$p_k = t$$$, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp's path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.Polycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection $$$s$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as $$$v$$$. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $$$s$$$ to $$$v$$$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $$$v$$$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $$$w$$$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $$$w$$$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $$$w$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $$$t$$$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ ($$$s = 1$$$, $$$t = 4$$$): Check the picture by the link http://tk.codeforces.com/a.png   When Polycarp starts at $$$1$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. There is only one such path, it is $$$[1, 5, 4]$$$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$2$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$2$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, for example, $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ (note that it could choose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$3$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$3$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$, which is $$$[3, 4]$$$;  Polycarp arrives at $$$4$$$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. Overall, we get $$$2$$$ rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$ instead of $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ during the second step, there would be only $$$1$$$ rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path $$$[3, 4]$$$ during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same.

Otherwise, return \"YES\"\n\nWait, let me reconsider the constraint more carefully...\n\nActually, the key insight is simpler:\n- For each color, we need to distribute all balloons of that color to different friends\n- If a color appears `count` times, we need at least `count` friends to distribute them\n- Since we have `k` friends, we can distribute balloons of any color as long as `count ≤ k`\n\nBut there's also the constraint that we must distribute ALL balloons.\n\nLet me re-read... Actually, the main constraint is just that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. The goal is to distribute ALL balloons.\n\nSo the approach is:\n1.

{"description": "The Floral Clock has been standing by the side of Mirror Lake for years. Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days.On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well — symmetry is beautiful!Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n = 6 that cover all possibilities.  The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments. Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty equals 0. For instance, the beauty of the above arrangement equals 1 × 3 × 1 × 3 = 9 — the segments are {2}, {4, 5, 6}, {8} and {10, 11, 12}.While keeping the constraints satisfied, there may be lots of different arrangements.

An **odd number** of subsegments\n2. Each subsegment must have **odd length**\n3. Each subsegment must **start and end with odd numbers**\n\n## Key Insights\n\nLet me think about what this means:\n- If we have an odd number of subsegments, and each has odd length, then the total length = sum of odd lengths = odd × odd = odd\n- So if n is even, it's impossible!\n- If n is odd, we need to check if we can partition it appropriately\n\n## Deeper Analysis\n\nLet's think about the constraints:\n- Each subsegment has odd length and starts/ends with odd numbers\n- If we have k subsegments (k is odd), and each has length ≥ 1 (and odd), minimum total length is k\n- Since k is odd and each subsegment length is odd, total length n must be odd\n\nSo first condition: **n must be odd**\n\nNow, for the actual division:\n- We need to place dividers such that each segment starts and ends with odd numbers\n- This means at each \"cut point\", we need to ensure the previous segment ends with odd and next segment starts with odd\n\n## Strategy\n\nSince we need an odd number of segments, let's consider the simplest case: 1 segment (which is odd).\nThis works if the entire sequence starts and ends with odd numbers.\n\nFor more segments, we need to make cuts. Each cut creates one more segment, so to get an odd number of segments from 1 segment, we need an even number of cuts.\n\nActually, let me think differently:\n\nIf we want k segments where k is odd, we need k-1 cuts (dividers). Since k is odd, k-1 is even.\n\nBut we also need each segment to have odd length and start/end with odd numbers.\n\n## Simpler Approach\n\nLet me reframe: \n- The sequence must start with an odd number (first segment starts with it)\n- The sequence must end with an odd number (last segment ends with it)\n- At each cut point, the element before cut must be odd (end of previous segment) and element after cut must be odd (start of next segment)\n\nSo I need:\n1. First element is odd\n2. Last element is odd  \n3. Can make an even number of valid cuts (to get odd number of segments)\n\nWait, let me trace through examples:\n\nExample 1: [1, 3, 5] - n=3 (odd), first=1 (odd), last=5 (odd) → Yes\nExample 2: [1, 0, 1, 5, 1] - n=5 (odd), first=1 (odd), last=1 (odd) → Yes\nExample 3: [4, 3, 1] - n=3 (odd), first=4 (even) → No\nExample 4: [3, 9, 9, 3] - n=4 (even) → No\n\nSo the key insight is:\n1. n must be odd\n2. first element must be odd  \n3. last element must be odd\n\nWhy? Because we're essentially checking if we can divide into 1 segment (the minimal odd number), which requires the whole sequence to start and end with odd numbers. Since the length is odd, a single segment satisfies all conditions.\n\nBut wait, example 2 shows we can have multiple segments...\n\nLet me reconsider. We need ANY odd number of valid segments.\n\nThe key insight is that since each segment must have odd length, and we want odd number of segments, total length must be odd. \n\nAnd since each segment must start and end with odd numbers, we're essentially looking at positions where we can \"break\" the array.\n\n## Correct Approach\n\nHere's the right way to think:\n1. n must be odd (since sum of odd number of odd lengths = odd)\n2. a[0] must be odd (first segment starts with it)  \n3. a[n-1] must be odd (last segment ends with it)\n\nThis is sufficient! Here's why:\n\nIf these conditions hold, we can always create a valid partition:\n- Simplest: 1 segment (the whole array) - length n (odd), starts with a[0] (odd), ends with a[n-1] (odd) ✓\n- Or we can split further if needed, but the existence of at least one valid partition is guaranteed\n\nLet me verify with examples:\n1.

(x2 - x1) must be divisible by x\n2. (y2 - y1) must be divisible by y\n3. We need to find non-negative integers a, b, c, d that satisfy our equations\n\nFrom our definitions:\n- u = a + b - c - d\n- v = a + c - b - d\n\nAdding these equations:\n- u + v = 2(a - d)\n- u - v = 2(b - c)\n\nSo:\n- a - d = (u + v)/2\n- b - c = (u - v)/2\n\nThis means (u + v) and (u - v) must both be even, which means u and v must have the same parity (both odd or both even).\n\n## Solution Approach\n\n1. Check if (x2 - x1) is divisible by x\n2. Check if (y2 - y1) is divisible by y\n3. Calculate u = (x2 - x1)/x and v = (y2 - y1)/y\n4.

The robot ends up back at (0,0) after processing all commands\n5. We need to find the maximum number of commands that could have been executed correctly\n\n## Key Insights\n\nFor the robot to end up at (0,0):\n- The number of upward moves (U) must equal the number of downward moves (D)\n- The number of rightward moves (R) must equal the number of leftward moves (L)\n\nSo if we have counts of each command type, the maximum correct commands would be:\n- Up/Down pairs: min(count_U, count_D) × 2\n- Left/Right pairs: min(count_L, count_R) × 2\n- Total = 2 × (min(count_U, count_D) + min(count_L, count_R))\n\nWait, let me think again. We want the maximum number of commands that could be executed such that we end at (0,0).\n\nActually, we need to find the maximum subset of commands that results in net displacement of (0,0).\n\n## Approach\n\nLet's count:\n- U_count: number of 'U' commands\n- D_count: number of 'D' commands  \n- L_count: number of 'L' commands\n- R_count: number of 'R' commands\n\nFor ending at (0,0):\n- Net vertical movement = 0: So we can use min(U_count, D_count) pairs\n- Net horizontal movement = 0: So we can use min(L_count, R_count) pairs\n\nMaximum commands executed = 2 × (min(U_count, D_count) + min(L_count, R_count))\n\nWait, that's not right either. Let me re-read...\n\nWe have a fixed sequence. We want to find what's the maximum number of commands from this sequence that could be executed while still ending at (0,0).\n\nSo we can choose to execute some subset of commands, and we want the maximum size of such a subset that results in net zero displacement.\n\nThis means:\n- From U and D commands, we can execute min(U_count, D_count) pairs\n- From L and R commands, we can execute min(L_count, R_count) pairs\n- Total executed = 2 × (min(U_count, D_count) + min(L_count, R_count))\n\nNo wait, I'm overcomplicating. \n\nIf we have U_count 'U' commands and D_count 'D' commands, to end at same vertical level, we can execute at most min(U_count, D_count) 'U' commands and min(U_count, D_count) 'D' commands. Same for L/R.\n\nSo maximum executed = 2 × min(U_count, D_count) + 2 × min(L_count, R_count)\n\nActually no... \nMaximum executed U/D commands = 2 × min(U_count, D_count)\nMaximum executed L/R commands = 2 × min(L_count, R_count)\nTotal = 2 × (min(U_count, D_count) + min(L_count, R_count))\n\nLet me trace through examples:\n\nExample 1: \"LDUR\"\n- U=1, D=1, L=1, R=1\n- Can execute: 2×min(1,1) + 2×min(1,1) = 2 + 2 = 4 ✓\n\nExample 2: \"RRRUU\"  \n- U=2, D=0, L=0, R=3\n- Can execute: 2×min(2,0) + 2×min(0,3) = 0 + 0 = 0 ✓\n\nExample 3: \"LLRRRR\"\n- U=0, D=0, L=2, R=4  \n- Can execute: 2×min(0,0) + 2×min(2,4) = 0 + 4 = 4 ✓\n\nThis matches!\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    commands = input().strip()\n    \n    # Count each type of command\n    u_count = commands.count('U')\n    d_count = commands.count('D')\n    l_count = commands.count('L')\n    r_count = commands.count('R')\n    \n    # Maximum commands that can be executed while ending at (0,0)\n    # We can pair up U with D, and L with R\n    vertical_pairs = min(u_count, d_count)\n    horizontal_pairs = min(l_count, r_count)\n    \n    max_executed = 2 * vertical_pairs + 2 * horizontal_pairs\n    \n    return max_executed\n\n# Read input and solve\nresult = solve()\nprint(result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [466], "completion_tokens": [1042], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "b9fa2bb8001bd064ede531a5281cfd8a"}

In one step, we can:\n   - Put a pin on the border of the circle\n   - Rotate the circle around that pin by any angle\n   - Remove the pin\n\n## Key Insights\n\nLet's think about what happens in each step:\n- When we pin the circle at a point on its border and rotate, the center can move in an arc\n- The maximum distance the center can move in one step is `2*r` (when we rotate 180 degrees)\n\n## Analysis of Possible Cases\n\nLet `d` = distance between current center and target center = `sqrt((x'-x)² + (y'-y)²)`\n\n**Case 1: d = 0**\n- Already at target → 0 steps\n\n**Case 2: d ≤ 2*r**\n- Can reach in 1 step by rotating appropriately\n\n**Case 3: d > 2*r**\n- Need multiple steps\n- In each step, we can move at most `2*r` distance\n- So we need `ceil(d / (2*r))` steps\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully...\n\n## Deeper Analysis\n\nWhen we pin a point on the border and rotate:\n- The center moves along a circle of radius `2*r` (since the pin is at distance `r` from center)\n- Actually, the center can move to any point within distance `2*r` from current position\n\nBut we need to be more precise:\n- If we pin at point P on the border, and rotate 180°, the center moves by exactly `2*r` in the direction from current center to P\n- By choosing different pin points, we can move the center in any direction\n- So in one step, we can move the center to any point within a circle of radius `2*r` centered at current position\n\nTherefore:\n- If `d = 0`: 0 steps\n- If `d ≤ 2*r`: 1 step  \n- If `d > 2*r`: `ceil(d / (2*r))` steps\n\nLet me verify with examples:\n\n**Example 1:** r=2, (0,0) → (0,4)\n- d = 4, 2*r = 4, so d ≤ 2*r → 1 step ✓\n\n**Example 2:** r=1, (1,1) → (4,4)  \n- d = sqrt(9+9) = 3*sqrt(2) ≈ 4.24, 2*r = 2, so d > 2*r\n- ceil(4.24/2) = ceil(2.12) = 3 steps ✓\n\n**Example 3:** r=4, (5,6) → (5,6)\n- d = 0 → 0 steps ✓\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef min_steps(r, x, y, x_dest, y_dest):\n    # Calculate distance between current and destination centers\n    d = math.sqrt((x_dest - x)**2 + (y_dest - y)**2)\n    \n    # Case analysis\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif d <= 2 * r:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Need multiple steps, each step can move at most 2*r\n        return math.ceil(d / (2 * r))\n\n# Read input\nline = input().strip()\nr, x, y, x_dest, y_dest = map(int, line.split())\n\n# Solve and output\nresult = min_steps(r, x, y, x_dest, y_dest)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet me double-check the logic once more:\n\nThe key insight is that when we fix a point on the circumference and rotate the circle, the center traces a circle of radius 2r around its current position. So in one operation, we can move the center anywhere within distance 2r from its current location.\n\nThis means:\n- Distance 0: 0 steps\n- Distance ≤ 2r: 1 step  \n- Distance > 2r: ⌈distance/(2r)⌉ steps\n\n```python\nimport math\n\ndef min_steps(r, x, y, x_dest, y_dest):\n    # Calculate distance between current and destination centers\n    d = math.sqrt((x_dest - x)**2 + (y_dest - y)**2)\n    \n    # Case analysis\n    if d == 0:\n        return 0\n    elif d <= 2 * r:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Need multiple steps, each step can move at most 2*r\n        return math.ceil(d / (2 * r))\n\n# Read input\nline = input().strip()\nr, x, y, x_dest, y_dest = map(int, line.split())\n\n# Solve and output\nresult = min_steps(r, x, y, x_dest, y_dest)\nprint(result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [403], "completion_tokens": [1088], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "698da80c7d24252b57cca4e4f0ca7031"}

{"description": "Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p = [p1, p2, ..., pn] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on.Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p = [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] is (421)(5)(63).Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4, 1, 6, 2, 5, 3] will become [4, 2, 1, 5, 6, 3].Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list.

Vasya has `a` red socks and `b` blue socks\n2. First, he wants to wear different colored socks each day (one red, one blue)\n3. After he can't make different pairs anymore, he wears same colored socks each day\n4. We need to find:\n   - Maximum days he can wear different socks\n   - Days he can wear same socks after that\n\n## Analysis\n\nLet's think about this:\n\n1. **Different socks period**: He needs 1 red + 1 blue sock per day\n   - Maximum days = min(a, b) (limited by whichever color he has fewer of)\n\n2. **Same socks period**: After using min(a,b) pairs, he'll have:\n   - Remaining red socks = a - min(a,b)\n   - Remaining blue socks = b - min(a,b)\n   - One of these will be 0, and the other will be |a-b|\n   - He can make pairs from the remaining socks: |a-b| // 2 days\n\nWait, let me recheck this with the examples:\n\n**Example 1: a=3, b=1**\n- Different socks days: min(3,1) = 1 day\n- Remaining: red=2, blue=0\n- Same socks days: min(2,0) = 0... but answer is 1\n\nLet me re-read... he can wear SAME socks (both red or both blue) until he runs out or can't make a pair.\n\nSo for same socks, he needs 2 socks of the same color per day.\n\n**Example 1 revisited: a=3, b=1**\n- Different socks: min(3,1) = 1 day\n- Remaining: red=2, blue=0  \n- Same socks: He has 2 red socks left, so he can make 2//2 = 1 pair = 1 day\n\n**Example 2: a=2, b=3**\n- Different socks: min(2,3) = 2 days\n- Remaining: red=0, blue=1\n- Same socks: min(0//2, 1//2) = min(0,0) = 0 days\n\n**Example 3: a=7, b=3**\n- Different socks: min(7,3) = 3 days  \n- Remaining: red=4, blue=0\n- Same socks: He can make 4//2 = 2 pairs = 2 days\n\nPerfect! This matches.\n\n## Solution Approach\n\n1. Different socks days = min(a, b)\n2. After wearing different socks:\n   - Remaining red = a - min(a,b)\n   - Remaining blue = b - min(a,b)\n3. Same socks days = (remaining_red // 2) + (remaining_blue // 2)\n   But since one of them will be 0, it's just max(remaining_red, remaining_blue) // 2\n\nActually, let me think more carefully:\n- remaining_red = a - min(a,b) = a - b if a ≤ b, or 0 if a ≥ b\n- remaining_blue = b - min(a,b) = b - a if b ≤ a, or 0 if b ≥ a\n\nSo one of them is 0, and the other is |a-b|.\nTherefore: same socks days = |a-b| // 2\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef solve_socks(a, b):\n    # Maximum days with different socks (one red, one blue)\n    different_days = min(a, b)\n    \n    # Remaining socks after wearing different pairs\n    remaining_red = a - different_days\n    remaining_blue = b - different_days\n    \n    # Maximum days with same socks (both red or both blue)\n    # We can make pairs from remaining socks\n    same_days = (remaining_red + remaining_blue) // 2\n    \n    return different_days, same_days\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Solve and print result\ndifferent_days, same_days = solve_socks(a, b)\nprint(different_days, same_days)\n```\n\nLet me verify with examples:\n\n1. a=3, b=1: different=min(3,1)=1, remaining=2,0, same=(2+0)//2=1 ✓\n2. a=2, b=3: different=min(2,3)=2, remaining=0,1, same=(0+1)//2=0 ✓  \n3. a=7, b=3: different=min(7,3)=3, remaining=4,0, same=(4+0)//2=2 ✓\n\nPerfect!\n\n```python\ndef solve_socks(a, b):\n    # Maximum days with different socks (one red, one blue)\n    different_days = min(a, b)\n    \n    # Remaining socks after wearing different pairs\n    remaining_red = a - different_days\n    remaining_blue = b - different_days\n    \n    # Maximum days with same socks (both red or both blue)\n    # We can make pairs from remaining socks\n    same_days = (remaining_red + remaining_blue) // 2\n    \n    return different_days, same_days\n\n# Read input\na, b = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Solve and print result\ndifferent_days, same_days = solve_socks(a, b)\nprint(different_days, same_days)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [446], "completion_tokens": [1154], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "775766790e91e539c1cfaa5030e5b955"}

If Yang's ATK ≤ monster's DEF, he deals 0 damage → impossible to win\n2. If monster's ATK ≤ Yang's DEF, monster deals 0 damage → Yang wins automatically\n3.

2\n- Players alternate taking pawns\n- The key insight is about controlling the center and forcing opponent into bad positions\n\nLooking at the pattern:\n- n=2: White wins (can capture immediately)\n- n=3: Black wins \n- For larger n, we need to see the parity of available moves\n\nActually, let me re-read the problem... \n\nThe critical insight seems to be:\n- When n is even vs odd affects the outcome due to parity of moves\n- But it's not just about total pawns, it's about optimal play structure\n\nLet me think differently:\n\n**Critical Observation**: \n- White starts at (1,1), black at (1,n)\n- They're on the same row initially\n- The middle region needs careful analysis\n\nAfter working through more examples:\n- n=2: White wins (direct capture)\n- n=3: Black wins (as given)\n- n=4: Let's think...\n\nFor n=4: There are more \"safe\" moves, and white might have advantage due to first move.\n\n## Mathematical Approach\n\nLooking at this more systematically:\n\nThe key insight is that when n is even, white has a winning strategy, and when n is odd, black has a winning strategy.\n\nBut let me verify with given examples:\n- n=2 (even): White wins ✓\n- n=3 (odd): Black wins ✓\n\nSo the pattern seems to be:\n- If n is even: White wins\n- If n is odd: Black wins\n\nNow for white's first move when white wins:\n- Should be a winning move\n- Among winning moves, choose minimum r, then minimum c\n\nWhen n=2: White can move to (1,2) to capture black queen directly.\n\nWhen n is even and > 2: White should move toward the center to control the game.\n\nLet me think of the optimal first move for white when n is even:\n- Moving to (1,2) captures a pawn and maintains good position\n- This seems like a safe and good first move\n\n## Solution\n\n```python\ndef solve(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        # White wins when n is even\n        return \"white\", 1, 2\n    else:\n        # Black wins when n is odd\n        return \"black\", None, None\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\n\n# Solve\nresult = solve(n)\n\n# Output\nif result[0] == \"white\":\n    print(\"white\")\n    print(result[1], result[2])\nelse:\n    print(\"black\")\n```\n\nWait, let me double-check this logic against the examples:\n\nn=2: Even → White wins, move to (1,2) ✓\nn=3: Odd → Black wins ✓\n\nThis matches!\n\nLet me finalize the solution:\n\n```python\ndef solve_chess(n):\n    if n % 2 == 0:\n        # White wins when n is even\n        return \"white\", 1, 2\n    else:\n        # Black wins when n is odd\n        return \"black\", None, None\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\n\n# Solve\nresult = solve_chess(n)\n\n# Output\nif result[0] == \"white\":\n    print(\"white\")\n    print(result[1], result[2])\nelse:\n    print(\"black\")\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [791], "completion_tokens": [1145], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "52e07d176aa1d370788f94ee2e61df93"}

We have an alphabet of `n` letters\n2. Each letter `i` can appear at most `a[i]` times in our string\n3. All letters that appear in the string must have distinct occurrence counts\n4. We want to maximize the total length of the string\n\n## Approach\n\nThis is essentially about assigning distinct frequencies to each letter we choose to include, such that:\n- Each frequency is ≤ the letter's limit\n- All frequencies are distinct\n- Sum of frequencies is maximized\n\nStrategy:\n1. Sort the limits in descending order\n2. For each position, assign the maximum possible distinct value\n3. Since we want distinct values and maximum sum, we should assign values like: max_available, max_available-1, max_available-2, etc.\n\nWait, let me think more carefully...\n\nActually, we need to:\n1. Decide which letters to include (we don't have to use all)\n2. Assign distinct frequencies to included letters\n3. Maximize the sum\n\nBest approach:\n- Sort limits in descending order\n- For k letters, we want k distinct frequencies\n- To maximize sum, we should use the largest possible distinct values\n- For the first k letters (in sorted order), assign frequencies: min(a[0], max_freq), min(a[1], max_freq-1), ..., min(a[k-1], max_freq-k+1)\n\nBut what's the optimal max_freq? We can try different numbers of letters.\n\nEven better approach:\n- Sort the array in descending order\n- Try using k letters for k = 1, 2, ..., n\n- For k letters, assign frequencies k, k-1, k-2, ..., 1 (or adjust based on limits)\n- Actually, assign the largest possible distinct values within limits\n\nLet me reframe:\n- Sort limits in descending order: a[0] ≥ a[1] ≥ ... ≥ a[n-1]\n- For using k letters, optimally we'd like to assign frequencies k, k-1, k-2, ..., 1\n- But if a[i] < (k-i), we need to adjust\n- Better: assign min(a[0], k), min(a[1], k-1), ..., min(a[k-1], 1)\n\nWait, even clearer approach:\n- Sort limits in descending order\n- For k letters, assign frequencies as high as possible but distinct\n- That means: min(a[0], M), min(a[1], M-1), min(a[2], M-2), ..., min(a[k-1], M-k+1)\n- Where M is chosen to maximize the sum\n\nActually, simplest correct approach:\n- Sort in descending order\n- For k letters, assign frequencies k, k-1, k-2, ..., 1 (if possible)\n- If a[i] < (k-i), we get a[i] instead of (k-i)\n- So sum = sum of min(a[i], k-i) for i = 0 to k-1\n\nNo wait, I'm confusing the indexing. Let me restart:\n\n## Clear Approach\n\n1. Sort the limits in descending order\n2. Try all possible numbers of letters to include (k = 1 to n)\n3. For k letters, the optimal assignment is to give them frequencies k, k-1, k-2, ..., 1 (to make them distinct)\n4. But each frequency cannot exceed the corresponding letter's limit\n5. So actual frequencies will be min(a[0], k), min(a[1], k-1), ..., min(a[k-1], 1)\n6. Calculate sum for each k and return maximum\n\nLet me trace through examples:\n\nExample 1: [2, 5, 5] → sorted: [5, 5, 2]\n\nk=1: use 1 letter, frequency min(5,1) = 1, sum = 1\nk=2: use 2 letters, frequencies min(5,2)=2, min(5,1)=1, sum = 3  \nk=3: use 3 letters, frequencies min(5,3)=3, min(5,2)=2, min(2,1)=1, sum = 6\n\nWait, this doesn't match expected output 11. Let me re-read...\n\nAh, I see the issue. We can assign any distinct frequencies, not necessarily consecutive sequence starting from k.\n\nBetter approach:\n- Sort limits in descending order\n- For k letters, assign the k largest possible distinct values that don't exceed respective limits\n- This is equivalent to: assign frequencies f[0] ≥ f[1] ≥ ... ≥ f[k-1] where f[i] ≤ a[i] and all f[i] are distinct\n\nGreedy way:\n- Take the k largest limits\n- Assign to them k largest possible distinct frequencies\n\nEven simpler and correct approach:\n- Sort limits in descending order: a[0] ≥ a[1] ≥ ... ≥ a[n-1]  \n- Greedy assignment: f[i] = max(0, min(a[i], max_allowed))\n- Where max_allowed starts from infinity and decreases\n\nActually, the clean mathematical way:\n- Sort a in descending order\n- f[0] = a[0] \n- f[1] = min(a[1], f[0]-1)\n- f[2] = min(a[2], f[1]-1)\n- ...\n- f[i] = min(a[i], f[i-1]-1)\n\nBut we might want to use fewer letters. So try all prefixes.\n\nNo! Even better - just do the above procedure, it will naturally stop including letters when their adjusted limit becomes 0.\n\nFinal approach:\n1. Sort array in descending order\n2. f[0] = a[0]\n3. f[i] = min(a[i], f[i-1]-1) for i = 1, 2, ..., n-1\n4. Sum all positive f[i]\n\nBut we should also consider that we might get better results by skipping some elements. \n\nActually, let's prove that greedy is optimal here when sorted in descending order:\nIf a ≥ b, and we're assigning distinct frequencies, we should give higher frequency to 'a' to maximize sum.\n\nSo yes, sort descending, then greedy assignment works.\n\nLet me trace example 1 again: [2, 5, 5] → sorted: [5, 5, 2]\nf[0] = 5\nf[1] = min(5, 5-1) = 4  \nf[2] = min(2, 4-1) = 2\nSum = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11 ✓\n\nExample 2: [1, 1, 2] → sorted: [2, 1, 1]\nf[0] = 2\nf[1] = min(1, 2-1) = 1\nf[2] = min(1, 1-1) = 0\nSum = 2 + 1 + 0 = 3 ✓\n\nPerfect!\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Sort in descending order\n    a.sort(reverse=True)\n    \n    # Greedy assignment\n    total_length = 0\n    prev_freq = float('inf')\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        # Current frequency should be at most (prev_freq - 1) and at most a[i]\n        current_freq = min(a[i], prev_freq - 1) if prev_freq > 0 else 0\n        if current_freq <= 0:\n            break\n        total_length += current_freq\n        prev_freq = current_freq\n    \n    return total_length\n\nprint(solve())\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [378], "completion_tokens": [1668], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "3c4b2d1c9440515bc3002eddd2b89f6f"}

{"description": "Vasya started working in a machine vision company of IT City. Vasya's team creates software and hardware for identification of people by their face.One of the project's know-how is a camera rotating around its optical axis on shooting. People see an eye-catching gadget — a rotating camera — come up to it to see it better, look into it. And the camera takes their photo at that time. What could be better for high quality identification?But not everything is so simple. The pictures from camera appear rotated too (on clockwise camera rotation frame the content becomes rotated counter-clockwise). But the identification algorithm can work only with faces that are just slightly deviated from vertical.Vasya was entrusted to correct the situation — to rotate a captured image so that image would be minimally deviated from vertical. Requirements were severe. Firstly, the picture should be rotated only on angle divisible by 90 degrees to not lose a bit of information about the image. Secondly, the frames from the camera are so huge and FPS is so big that adequate rotation speed is provided by hardware FPGA solution only. And this solution can rotate only by 90 degrees clockwise. Of course, one can apply 90 degrees turn several times but for the sake of performance the number of turns should be minimized.Help Vasya implement the program that by the given rotation angle of the camera can determine the minimum number of 90 degrees clockwise turns necessary to get a picture in which up direction deviation from vertical is minimum.The next figure contains frames taken from an unrotated camera, then from rotated 90 degrees clockwise, then from rotated 90 degrees counter-clockwise.

So if the camera rotates `x` degrees clockwise, the image is effectively rotated `-x` degrees (i.e., counter-clockwise).\n   - We need to rotate the image back to as close to upright (vertical) as possible using only 90-degree clockwise rotations.\n   - We want the minimum number of such rotations (0 to 3).\n\n2. **Key Observations**:\n   - The effective image rotation is `-x` degrees.\n   - Each 90-degree clockwise turn adds 90 degrees to the image rotation.\n   - Total image rotation after `k` turns is `-x + 90*k`.\n   - We want this total to be as close to a multiple of 360 degrees as possible (i.e., close to 0 degrees modulo 360).\n   - So we want to minimize `abs((-x + 90*k) % 360)` over `k = 0, 1, 2, 3`.\n\n3. **Approach**:\n   - Compute the effective image rotation: `image_rotation = -x`\n   - Try all values of `k` from 0 to 3.\n   - For each `k`, compute `total_rotation = image_rotation + 90*k`\n   - Compute the deviation from upright: `deviation = abs(total_rotation % 360)`\n     - But we must be careful here. For example, 330 degrees clockwise is equivalent to 30 degrees counter-clockwise. So the deviation should be `min(abs(total_rotation % 360), 360 - abs(total_rotation % 360))`.\n   - Find the `k` that gives the minimum deviation.\n\n4. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Large values of `x` (up to 10^18), so we need to handle large numbers efficiently.\n   - Use modular arithmetic to simplify calculations.\n\nHere is the Python implementation:\n\n```python\ndef main():\n    import sys\n    input = sys.stdin.read\n    x = int(input().strip())\n    \n    # Effective image rotation due to camera rotation\n    image_rotation = -x\n    \n    min_deviation = float('inf')\n    best_k = 0\n    \n    for k in range(4):\n        # Total rotation after k clockwise 90-degree turns\n        total_rotation = image_rotation + 90 * k\n        \n        # Normalize to [0, 360) to compute deviation\n        normalized = total_rotation % 360\n        \n        # The deviation is the minimum distance to 0 degree\n        deviation = min(normalized, 360 - normalized)\n        \n        if deviation < min_deviation:\n            min_deviation = deviation\n            best_k = k\n            \n    print(best_k)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [763], "completion_tokens": [653], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "509db9cb6156b692557ba874a09f150e"}

He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. The content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.And he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. For example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".After receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.At a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint.

When we flip a subarray, 0s become 1s (gaining 1s) and 1s become 0s (losing 1s)\n3. Net effect = (number of 0s in subarray) - (number of 1s in subarray)\n4. We want to maximize this net gain\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Calculate initial count of 1s\n2. For every possible subarray [i,j], calculate net gain = (count of 0s) - (count of 1s)\n3. Find the maximum net gain\n4. Answer = initial count + maximum net gain\n\n## Optimization\n\nInstead of counting 0s and 1s separately, we can think of it as:\n- Each 0 contributes +1 to net gain (we gain a 1)\n- Each 1 contributes -1 to net gain (we lose a 1)\n\nSo we can transform the array: 0 → +1, 1 → -1\nThen find the maximum subarray sum (which represents maximum net gain).\n\nThis becomes the maximum subarray problem!\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Transform array: 0 → 1, 1 → -1\n2. Find maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm\n3. Add this to initial count of 1s\n\nLet me trace through the first example:\n- Array: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n- Initial 1s: 2\n- Transformed: [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]\n- Max subarray sum: 1+1+(-1)+1 = 2 (indices 1 to 4, 0-indexed)\n- Answer: 2 + 2 = 4 ✓\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    n = int(input())\n    a = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Count initial number of ones\n    initial_ones = sum(a)\n    \n    # Transform array: 0 -> 1, 1 -> -1\n    # This way, finding max subarray sum gives us the maximum net gain\n    transformed = []\n    for x in a:\n        if x == 0:\n            transformed.append(1)   # gaining a 1\n        else:\n            transformed.append(-1)  # losing a 1\n    \n    # Find maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm\n    max_gain = float('-inf')\n    current_sum = 0\n    \n    for i in range(n):\n        current_sum += transformed[i]\n        max_gain = max(max_gain, current_sum)\n        if current_sum < 0:\n            current_sum = 0\n    \n    # The answer is initial ones plus the maximum gain\n    result = initial_ones + max_gain\n    print(result)\n\n# Read input and solve\nsolve()\n```\n\nLet me verify with the examples:\n\nExample 1: [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]\n- Initial ones: 2\n- Transformed: [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1]\n- Kadane's: max subarray sum = 1+1+(-1)+1 = 2 (from index 1 to 4)\n- Result: 2 + 2 = 4 ✓\n\nExample 2: [1, 0, 0, 1]\n- Initial ones: 2  \n- Transformed: [-1, 1, 1, -1]\n- Kadane's: max subarray sum = 1+1 = 2 (from index 1 to 2)\n- Result: 2 + 2 = 4 ✓\n\nThe solution looks correct!"], "prompt_tokens": [522], "completion_tokens": [885], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "9b543e07e805fe1dd8fa869d5d7c8b99"}

Initialize DP array where `dp[i]` represents max profit with `i` grams of dough\n2. For each stuffing type, update the DP array by considering making different numbers of buns\n3. Also consider making buns without stuffing\n4. Return `dp[n]`\n\nLet me trace through the first example:\n- n=10, m=2, c0=2, d0=1\n- Stuffing 1: a=7, b=3, c=2, d=100 → can make at most min(7//3, 10//2) = min(2,5) = 2 buns\n- Stuffing 2: a=12, b=3, c=1, d=10 → can make at most min(12//3, 10//1) = min(4,10) = 4 buns\n\nWait, let me re-read... the answer is 241, which means 2×100 + 4×10 + 1×1 = 241.\nSo we use: 2×2 + 4×1 + 1×2 = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 grams of dough. Perfect!\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    # Read input\n    line = input().split()\n    n, m, c0, d0 = int(line[0]), int(line[1]), int(line[2]), int(line[3])\n    \n    stuffings = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n        stuffings.append((a, b, c, d))\n    \n    # dp[i] represents maximum money with i grams of dough\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # First, consider buns without stuffing\n    for dough in range(c0, n + 1):\n        dp[dough] = max(dp[dough], dp[dough - c0] + d0)\n    \n    # For each stuffing type\n    for a, b, c, d in stuffings:\n        # We need to process this in forward direction to avoid using same stuffing multiple times in one iteration\n        # But actually, we can make multiple buns of same type, so we should update in forward direction\n        # Wait, no. We're doing this correctly - for each stuffing type, we consider all possibilities\n        \n        # Create a copy to avoid using updated values in same iteration\n        new_dp = dp[:]\n        \n        # Try making k buns of this stuffing type\n        max_buns = min(a // b, n // c)  # Upper bound on number of buns\n        for k in range(1, max_buns + 1):\n            dough_needed = k * c\n            if dough_needed <= n:\n                for dough in range(dough_needed, n + 1):\n                    new_dp[dough] = max(new_dp[dough], dp[dough - dough_needed] + k * d)\n        \n        dp = new_dp\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\n# Solve and print result\nprint(solve())\n```\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully. The approach above might be inefficient. Let me reconsider.\n\nA better approach is to iterate through dough amounts and for each stuffing, try adding different numbers of buns:\n\n```python\n# Read input\nline = input().split()\nn, m, c0, d0 = int(line[0]), int(line[1]), int(line[2]), int(line[3])\n\nstuffings = []\nfor _ in range(m):\n    a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n    stuffings.append((a, b, c, d))\n\n# dp[i] represents maximum money with i grams of dough\ndp = [0] * (n + 1)\n\n# Process each stuffing type\nfor a, b, c, d in stuffings:\n    # For each amount of dough, try making k buns of current stuffing type\n    for dough in range(n, -1, -1):  # Process backwards to avoid using updated values\n        max_buns = min(a // b, dough // c)\n        for k in range(1, max_buns + 1):\n            if dough >= k * c:\n                dp[dough] = max(dp[dough], dp[dough - k * c] + k * d)\n\n# Also consider buns without stuffing\nfor dough in range(c0, n + 1):\n    dp[dough] = max(dp[dough], dp[dough - c0] + d0)\n\nprint(dp[n])\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [559], "completion_tokens": [1352], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "4e166b8b44427b1227e0f811161d3a6f"}

We don't need to use all letters, just need to find the subsequence \"hello\"\n\n## Approach\n\nThis is a subsequence matching problem. I need to:\n1. Check if \"hello\" appears as a subsequence in the typed word `s`\n2. A subsequence means the letters appear in order, but not necessarily consecutively\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. Use two pointers approach:\n   - One pointer for the target word \"hello\" \n   - One pointer for the input string `s`\n2.
