{"description": "You are given a string $$$s$$$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. Let the length of $$$s$$$ be $$$|s|$$$.

We only need to remove characters when we have 3 or more consecutive 'x' characters\n2. For a sequence of `k` consecutive 'x' characters where `k \u2265 3`, we need to remove `k-2` characters to break the forbidden pattern\n3. For example:\n   - \"xxx\" (3 x's) \u2192 remove 1 character\n   - \"xxxx\" (4 x's) \u2192 remove 2 characters  \n   - \"xxxxx\" (5 x's) \u2192 remove 3 characters\n\n## Approach\n\n1. Scan through the string to find all consecutive sequences of 'x' characters\n2. For each sequence of length \u2265 3, add `(length - 2)` to our removal count\n3. Return the total count\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n1. Read input\n2. Traverse the string while counting consecutive 'x' characters\n3. When we encounter a non-'x' character or reach the end, check if the current sequence length \u2265 3\n4. If yes, add (sequence_length - 2) to our answer\n5.

{"description": "The map of Bertown can be represented as a set of $$$n$$$ intersections, numbered from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and connected by $$$m$$$ one-way roads. It is possible to move along the roads from any intersection to any other intersection. The length of some path from one intersection to another is the number of roads that one has to traverse along the path. The shortest path from one intersection $$$v$$$ to another intersection $$$u$$$ is the path that starts in $$$v$$$, ends in $$$u$$$ and has the minimum length among all such paths.Polycarp lives near the intersection $$$s$$$ and works in a building near the intersection $$$t$$$. Every day he gets from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ by car. Today he has chosen the following path to his workplace: $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_k$$$, where $$$p_1 = s$$$, $$$p_k = t$$$, and all other elements of this sequence are the intermediate intersections, listed in the order Polycarp arrived at them. Polycarp never arrived at the same intersection twice, so all elements of this sequence are pairwise distinct. Note that you know Polycarp's path beforehand (it is fixed), and it is not necessarily one of the shortest paths from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$.Polycarp's car has a complex navigation system installed in it. Let's describe how it works. When Polycarp starts his journey at the intersection $$$s$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$s$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. Let's denote the next intersection in the chosen path as $$$v$$$. If Polycarp chooses to drive along the road from $$$s$$$ to $$$v$$$, then the navigator shows him the same shortest path (obviously, starting from $$$v$$$ as soon as he arrives at this intersection). However, if Polycarp chooses to drive to another intersection $$$w$$$ instead, the navigator rebuilds the path: as soon as Polycarp arrives at $$$w$$$, the navigation system chooses some shortest path from $$$w$$$ to $$$t$$$ and shows it to Polycarp. The same process continues until Polycarp arrives at $$$t$$$: if Polycarp moves along the road recommended by the system, it maintains the shortest path it has already built; but if Polycarp chooses some other path, the system rebuilds the path by the same rules.Here is an example. Suppose the map of Bertown looks as follows, and Polycarp drives along the path $$$[1, 2, 3, 4]$$$ ($$$s = 1$$$, $$$t = 4$$$): Check the picture by the link http://tk.codeforces.com/a.png   When Polycarp starts at $$$1$$$, the system chooses some shortest path from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$. There is only one such path, it is $$$[1, 5, 4]$$$;  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$2$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$2$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing some shortest path from $$$2$$$ to $$$4$$$, for example, $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ (note that it could choose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$);  Polycarp chooses to drive to $$$3$$$, which is not along the path chosen by the system. When Polycarp arrives at $$$3$$$, the navigator rebuilds the path by choosing the only shortest path from $$$3$$$ to $$$4$$$, which is $$$[3, 4]$$$;  Polycarp arrives at $$$4$$$ along the road chosen by the navigator, so the system does not have to rebuild anything. Overall, we get $$$2$$$ rebuilds in this scenario. Note that if the system chose $$$[2, 3, 4]$$$ instead of $$$[2, 6, 4]$$$ during the second step, there would be only $$$1$$$ rebuild (since Polycarp goes along the path, so the system maintains the path $$$[3, 4]$$$ during the third step).The example shows us that the number of rebuilds can differ even if the map of Bertown and the path chosen by Polycarp stays the same.

We need to find the product of `f(x, i)` for i from 1 to n, modulo 10^9 + 7\n\n## Key Insights\n\nLet me analyze what `f(x, y)` actually computes:\n- For each prime factor p of x, we find the highest power of p that divides y\n- Then we multiply all these powers together\n\nSo if x = p1^a1 * p2^a2 * ... * pk^ak, then:\n`f(x, y) = g(y, p1) * g(y, p2) * ... * g(y, pk)`\n\nNow, when we compute the product of `f(x, i)` for i from 1 to n:\n```\nProduct = f(x, 1) * f(x, 2) * ... * f(x, n)\n        = Product over all prime factors p of x of (g(1,p) * g(2,p) * ... * g(n,p))\n```\n\nFor a fixed prime p, `g(i,p)` is the highest power of p that divides i.\nSo `g(1,p) * g(2,p) * ... * g(n,p)` is the product of all powers of p that divide numbers from 1 to n.\n\nThis equals `p^(v_p(n!))` where `v_p(n!)` is the exponent of prime p in n!.\n\nBy Legendre's formula: `v_p(n!) = sum_{i=1}^{\u221e} floor(n/p^i)`\n\n## Solution Approach\n\n1. Find all prime factors of x\n2. For each prime factor p, calculate `v_p(n!)` using Legendre's formula\n3. The answer is the product of `p^(v_p(n!))` for all prime factors p of x\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\ndef sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):\n    is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)\n    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False\n    \n    for i in range(2, int(limit**0.5) + 1):\n        if is_prime[i]:\n            for j in range(i*i, limit + 1, i):\n                is_prime[j] = False\n    \n    return [i for i in range(2, limit + 1) if is_prime[i]]\n\ndef prime_factors(n):\n    factors = set()\n    d = 2\n    while d * d <= n:\n        if n % d == 0:\n            factors.add(d)\n            while n % d == 0:\n                n //= d\n        d += 1\n    if n > 1:\n        factors.add(n)\n    return factors\n\ndef legendre_formula(n, p):\n    # Calculate v_p(n!) = sum of floor(n/p^i) for i >= 1\n    result = 0\n    power = p\n    while power <= n:\n        result += n // power\n        if power > n // p:  # Prevent overflow\n            break\n        power *= p\n    return result\n\ndef mod_pow(base, exp, mod):\n    result = 1\n    base = base % mod\n    while exp > 0:\n        if exp % 2 == 1:\n            result = (result * base) % mod\n        exp = exp >> 1\n        base = (base * base) % mod\n    return result\n\ndef solve(x, n):\n    MOD = 1000000007\n    \n    # Get prime factors of x\n    primes = prime_factors(x)\n    \n    result = 1\n    \n    for p in primes:\n        if p > n:\n            continue  # If p > n, then v_p(n!) = 0, so p^0 = 1\n        \n        # Calculate v_p(n!)\n        exponent = legendre_formula(n, p)\n        \n        # Multiply result by p^(v_p(n!))\n        result = (result * mod_pow(p, exponent, MOD)) % MOD\n    \n    return result\n\n# Read input\nline = input().strip()\nx, n = map(int, line.split())\n\n# Solve and print result\nprint(solve(x, n))\n```\n\nLet me trace through the first example:\n- x = 10 = 2 \u00d7 5, so primes = {2, 5}\n- n = 2\n\nFor p = 2: v_2(2!) = floor(2/2) = 1, so we get 2^1 = 2\nFor p = 5: v_5(2!) = floor(2/5) = 0, so we get 5^0 = 1\n\nResult = 2 \u00d7 1 = 2 \u2713\n\nThis matches the expected output."], "prompt_tokens": [771], "completion_tokens": [1095], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "04610fbaa746c083dda30e21fa6e1a0c"}

{"description": "Melody Pond was stolen from her parents as a newborn baby by Madame Kovarian, to become a weapon of the Silence in their crusade against the Doctor. Madame Kovarian changed Melody's name to River Song, giving her a new identity that allowed her to kill the Eleventh Doctor.Heidi figured out that Madame Kovarian uses a very complicated hashing function in order to change the names of the babies she steals. In order to prevent this from happening to future Doctors, Heidi decided to prepare herself by learning some basic hashing techniques.The first hashing function she designed is as follows.Given two positive integers $$$(x, y)$$$ she defines $$$H(x,y):=x^2+2xy+x+1$$$.Now, Heidi wonders if the function is reversible. That is, given a positive integer $$$r$$$, can you find a pair $$$(x, y)$$$ (of positive integers) such that $$$H(x, y) = r$$$?If multiple such pairs exist, output the one with smallest possible $$$x$$$.
