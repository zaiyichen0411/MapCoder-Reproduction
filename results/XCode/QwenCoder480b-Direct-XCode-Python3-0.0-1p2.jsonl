We have a circular pizza that needs to be divided into `n + 1` equal slices\n2. We want to find the minimum number of straight cuts needed\n3. A cut is a straight line segment (can extend inside or outside the pizza)\n\n## Key Insights\n\nLet me think about how to cut a circle into equal parts with minimum cuts:\n\n**Case 1: Even number of slices**\n- If we need an even number of slices, we can make cuts through the center\n- For example: 4 slices \u2192 2 cuts through center at 90\u00b0 angles\n- For 6 slices \u2192 3 cuts through center at 60\u00b0 angles\n- Pattern: For `k` slices where `k` is even \u2192 `k/2` cuts\n\n**Case 2: Odd number of slices**\n- If we need an odd number of slices, we cannot make all cuts through the center\n- Each cut can only create one additional region when dealing with odd divisions\n- For example: 3 slices \u2192 3 cuts (each cut adds one slice)\n- For 5 slices \u2192 5 cuts\n- Pattern: For `k` slices where `k` is odd \u2192 `k` cuts\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully by looking at the examples:\n\n- n = 3 \u2192 n+1 = 4 slices \u2192 answer = 2 cuts\n- n = 4 \u2192 n+1 = 5 slices \u2192 answer = 5 cuts\n\nThis confirms my analysis!\n\n## Mathematical Analysis\n\nFor `k` equal slices of a circle:\n- If `k` is even: We can make `k/2` cuts through the center\n- If `k` is odd: We need `k` cuts (each cut creates one additional slice)\n\nBut there's a special case: k = 1 (only Shiro eating), we need 0 cuts.\n\n## Solution Approach\n\n1. Calculate total slices needed: `slices = n + 1`\n2. If `slices = 1`: return 0\n3. If `slices` is even: return `slices // 2`\n4. If `slices` is odd: return `slices`\n\nLet me verify with examples:\n- n = 3 \u2192 slices = 4 (even) \u2192 4//2 = 2 \u2713\n- n = 4 \u2192 slices = 5 (odd) \u2192 5 \u2713\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\ndef min_cuts(n):\n    slices = n + 1\n    \n    if slices == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif slices % 2 == 0:\n        return slices // 2\n    else:\n        return slices\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\n\n# Calculate and print result\nresult = min_cuts(n)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet me double-check this logic:\n\nFor a circle divided into k equal parts:\n- k = 1: 0 cuts\n- k = 2: 1 cut (through center)\n- k = 3: 3 cuts \n- k = 4: 2 cuts (2 diameters)\n- k = 5: 5 cuts\n- k = 6: 3 cuts (3 diameters through center)\n\nThe pattern is:\n- If k = 1: 0 cuts\n- If k is even: k/2 cuts\n- If k is odd and k > 1: k cuts\n\nThis matches our solution.\n\n```python\ndef min_cuts(n):\n    slices = n + 1\n    \n    if slices == 1:\n        return 0\n    elif slices % 2 == 0:\n        return slices // 2\n    else:\n        return slices\n\n# Read input\nn = int(input())\n\n# Calculate and print result\nresult = min_cuts(n)\nprint(result)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [469], "completion_tokens": [816], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "236177ff30dafe68295b5d33dc501828"}

{"description": "Hasan loves playing games and has recently discovered a game called TopScore. In this soccer-like game there are $$$p$$$ players doing penalty shoot-outs. Winner is the one who scores the most. In case of ties, one of the top-scorers will be declared as the winner randomly with equal probability.They have just finished the game and now are waiting for the result. But there's a tiny problem! The judges have lost the paper of scores! Fortunately they have calculated sum of the scores before they get lost and also for some of the players they have remembered a lower bound on how much they scored. However, the information about the bounds is private, so Hasan only got to know his bound.According to the available data, he knows that his score is at least $$$r$$$ and sum of the scores is $$$s$$$.Thus the final state of the game can be represented in form of sequence of $$$p$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i$$$) \u2014 player's scores. Hasan is player number $$$1$$$, so $$$a_1 \\ge r$$$. Also $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_p = s$$$. Two states are considered different if there exists some position $$$i$$$ such that the value of $$$a_i$$$ differs in these states. Once again, Hasan doesn't know the exact scores (he doesn't know his exact score as well).
