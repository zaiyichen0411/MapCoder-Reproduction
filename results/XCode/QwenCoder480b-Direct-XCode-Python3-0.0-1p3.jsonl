Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days.On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well \u2014 symmetry is beautiful!Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them.

An **odd number** of subsegments\n2. Each subsegment must have **odd length**\n3. Each subsegment must **start and end with odd numbers**\n\n## Key Insights\n\nLet me think about what this means:\n- If we have an odd number of subsegments, and each has odd length, then the total length = sum of odd lengths = odd \u00d7 odd = odd\n- So if n is even, it's impossible!\n- If n is odd, we need to check if we can partition it appropriately\n\n## Deeper Analysis\n\nLet's think about the constraints:\n- Each subsegment has odd length and starts/ends with odd numbers\n- If we have k subsegments (k is odd), and each has length \u2265 1 (and odd), minimum total length is k\n- Since k is odd and each subsegment length is odd, total length n must be odd\n\nSo first condition: **n must be odd**\n\nNow, for the actual division:\n- We need to place dividers such that each segment starts and ends with odd numbers\n- This means at each \"cut point\", we need to ensure the previous segment ends with odd and next segment starts with odd\n\n## Strategy\n\nSince we need an odd number of segments, let's consider the simplest case: 1 segment (which is odd).\nThis works if the entire sequence starts and ends with odd numbers.\n\nFor more segments, we need to make cuts. Each cut creates one more segment, so to get an odd number of segments from 1 segment, we need an even number of cuts.\n\nActually, let me think differently:\n\nIf we want k segments where k is odd, we need k-1 cuts (dividers). Since k is odd, k-1 is even.\n\nBut we also need each segment to have odd length and start/end with odd numbers.\n\n## Simpler Approach\n\nLet me reframe: \n- The sequence must start with an odd number (first segment starts with it)\n- The sequence must end with an odd number (last segment ends with it)\n- At each cut point, the element before cut must be odd (end of previous segment) and element after cut must be odd (start of next segment)\n\nSo I need:\n1. First element is odd\n2. Last element is odd  \n3. Can make an even number of valid cuts (to get odd number of segments)\n\nWait, let me trace through examples:\n\nExample 1: [1, 3, 5] - n=3 (odd), first=1 (odd), last=5 (odd) \u2192 Yes\nExample 2: [1, 0, 1, 5, 1] - n=5 (odd), first=1 (odd), last=1 (odd) \u2192 Yes\nExample 3: [4, 3, 1] - n=3 (odd), first=4 (even) \u2192 No\nExample 4: [3, 9, 9, 3] - n=4 (even) \u2192 No\n\nSo the key insight is:\n1. n must be odd\n2. first element must be odd  \n3. last element must be odd\n\nWhy? Because we're essentially checking if we can divide into 1 segment (the minimal odd number), which requires the whole sequence to start and end with odd numbers. Since the length is odd, a single segment satisfies all conditions.\n\nBut wait, example 2 shows we can have multiple segments...\n\nLet me reconsider. We need ANY odd number of valid segments.\n\nThe key insight is that since each segment must have odd length, and we want odd number of segments, total length must be odd. \n\nAnd since each segment must start and end with odd numbers, we're essentially looking at positions where we can \"break\" the array.\n\n## Correct Approach\n\nHere's the right way to think:\n1. n must be odd (since sum of odd number of odd lengths = odd)\n2. a[0] must be odd (first segment starts with it)  \n3. a[n-1] must be odd (last segment ends with it)\n\nThis is sufficient! Here's why:\n\nIf these conditions hold, we can always create a valid partition:\n- Simplest: 1 segment (the whole array) - length n (odd), starts with a[0] (odd), ends with a[n-1] (odd) \u2713\n- Or we can split further if needed, but the existence of at least one valid partition is guaranteed\n\nLet me verify with examples:\n1.

(x2 - x1) must be divisible by x\n2. (y2 - y1) must be divisible by y\n3. We need to find non-negative integers a, b, c, d that satisfy our equations\n\nFrom our definitions:\n- u = a + b - c - d\n- v = a + c - b - d\n\nAdding these equations:\n- u + v = 2(a - d)\n- u - v = 2(b - c)\n\nSo:\n- a - d = (u + v)/2\n- b - c = (u - v)/2\n\nThis means (u + v) and (u - v) must both be even, which means u and v must have the same parity (both odd or both even).\n\n## Solution Approach\n\n1.
