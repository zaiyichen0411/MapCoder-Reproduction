{"description": "Special Agent Smart Beaver works in a secret research department of ABBYY. He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. The content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.And he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. For example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".After receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.At a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint. After receiving this information, and knowing his own speed of entering codes, the Smart Beaver will be able to determine whether he will have time for tonight's show \"Beavers are on the trail\" on his favorite TV channel, or he should work for a sleepless night...", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "1 second", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "The first line contains string s \u2014 the hint to the safe code.

We need to count valid codes based on a hint string\n2. Hint characters:\n   - `?` : any digit (0-9)\n   - `0-9`: fixed digit at that position\n   - `A-J`: variables representing digits (same letter = same digit, different letters = different digits)\n3. Constraints:\n   - No leading zeros (first digit can't be 0)\n   - Same letters must map to same digits\n   - Different letters must map to different digits\n\n## Approach\n\n1. **Identify unique letters** and their positions\n2. **Handle the first position specially** (no leading zero constraint)\n3. **Count valid assignments** for letters\n4. **Multiply by possibilities** for `?` characters\n\n## Step-by-step Solution\n\nLet me trace through the examples:\n\n**Example 1: \"AJ\"**\n- Positions: A(0), J(1)\n- First position (A): can be 1-9 (9 choices, no leading zero)\n- Second position (J): can be 0-9 except the digit chosen for A (9 choices)\n- Total: 9 \u00d7 9 = 81\n\n**Example 2: \"1?AA\"**\n- Position 0: fixed as '1'\n- Position 1: '?' can be 0-9 (10 choices)\n- Position 2,3: both 'A', so same digit\n- Since A appears at position 2 (not first), it can be 0-9 (10 choices)\n- Total: 1 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 100\n\n## Algorithm\n\n1. Find all unique letters and their first occurrence positions\n2. For each letter, calculate how many valid digit assignments are possible\n3. Handle the constraint that first position can't be 0\n4. Multiply possibilities for '?' characters\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Find unique letters and their first positions\n    letter_first_pos = {}\n    letters = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if 'A' <= char <= 'J':\n            if char not in letter_first_pos:\n                letter_first_pos[char] = i\n                letters.append(char)\n    \n    # Calculate number of ways to assign digits to letters\n    used_digits = 0\n    ways = 1\n    \n    for i, letter in enumerate(letters):\n        first_pos = letter_first_pos[letter]\n        \n        if first_pos == 0:  # First position - no leading zero\n            # Can't use 0 for first digit\n            choices = 10 - used_digits - 1  # 10 digits minus used ones, minus 0\n            if choices <= 0:\n                ways = 0\n                break\n            ways *= choices\n        else:  # Not first position\n            choices = 10 - used_digits  # Any unused digit\n            if choices <= 0:\n                ways = 0\n                break\n            ways *= choices\n        \n        used_digits += 1\n    \n    # Multiply by possibilities for '?'\n    question_marks = s.count('?')\n    ways *= (10 ** question_marks)\n    \n    print(ways)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nLet me verify with examples:\n\n**\"AJ\"**: \n- Letters: [A, J] \n- A at pos 0: 9 choices (1-9)\n- J at pos 1: 9 choices (0-9 except A's digit)\n- Total: 9 \u00d7 9 = 81 \u2713\n\n**\"1?AA\"**:\n- Letters: [A] (appears twice)\n- Position 0: fixed '1'\n- '?' : 10 choices\n- A at pos 2: 10 choices (0-9)\n- A at pos 3: must match pos 2, so 1 choice\n- Total: 1 \u00d7 10 \u00d7 10 = 100 \u2713\n\nWait, I think my approach isn't quite right. Let me reconsider...\n\nThe issue is that I'm processing letters one by one, but I should consider all letter constraints together.\n\nLet me revise:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Find unique letters and their first positions\n    letter_first_pos = {}\n    letters = []\n    \n    for i, char in enumerate(s):\n        if 'A' <= char <= 'J':\n            if char not in letter_first_pos:\n                letter_first_pos[char] = i\n                letters.append(char)\n    \n    # Calculate number of ways to assign digits to letters\n    used_count = 0\n    ways = 1\n    \n    for letter in letters:\n        first_pos = letter_first_pos[letter]\n        \n        if first_pos == 0:  # First position - no leading zero\n            # First letter in first position: 9 choices (1-9)\n            # Subsequent letters: decreasing choices\n            choices = 10 - used_count - 1  # -1 for excluding 0\n        else:  # Not first position\n            choices = 10 - used_count\n        \n        if choices <= 0:\n            ways = 0\n            break\n            \n        ways *= choices\n        used_count += 1\n    \n    # Multiply by possibilities for '?'\n    question_marks = s.count('?')\n    ways *= (10 ** question_marks)\n    \n    print(ways)\n\nsolve()\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [860], "completion_tokens": [1163], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "d3c10d1b1a17ad018359e2dab80d2b82"}

{"description": "The employees of the F company have lots of ways to entertain themselves. Today they invited a famous magician who shows a trick with plastic cups and a marble.The point is to trick the spectator's attention. Initially, the spectator stands in front of a line of n plastic cups. Then the magician places a small marble under one cup and shuffles the cups. Then the spectator should guess which cup hides the marble.But the head coder of the F company isn't easy to trick. When he saw the performance, he noticed several important facts:  each cup contains a mark \u2014 a number from 1 to n; all marks on the cups are distinct;  the magician shuffles the cups in m operations, each operation looks like that: take a cup marked xi, sitting at position yi in the row of cups (the positions are numbered from left to right, starting from 1) and shift it to the very beginning of the cup row (on the first position). When the head coder came home after work he wanted to re-do the trick. Unfortunately, he didn't remember the starting or the final position of the cups. He only remembered which operations the magician performed. Help the coder: given the operations in the order they were made find at least one initial permutation of the cups that can go through the described operations in the given order.
