{"description": "Iahub is training for the IOI. What is a better way to train than playing a Zuma-like game? There are n balls put in a row. Each ball is colored in one of k colors. Initially the row doesn't contain three or more contiguous balls with the same color. Iahub has a single ball of color x. He can insert his ball at any position in the row (probably, between two other balls). If at any moment there are three or more contiguous balls of the same color in the row, they are destroyed immediately. This rule is applied multiple times, until there are no more sets of 3 or more contiguous balls of the same color. For example, if Iahub has the row of balls [black, black, white, white, black, black] and a white ball, he can insert the ball between two white balls. Thus three white balls are destroyed, and then four black balls become contiguous, so all four balls are destroyed. The row will not contain any ball in the end, so Iahub can destroy all 6 balls.Iahub wants to destroy as many balls as possible. You are given the description of the row of balls, and the color of Iahub's ball.

We can use DP where:\n- State: `dp[dough_used]` = maximum money we can earn with `dough_used` grams of dough\n- Transitions: For each possible bun type, try making 0, 1, 2, ... buns of that type\n\nHowever, since we also have limited stuffing, we need to be more careful.\n\nActually, let me think differently:\n- We can make buns without stuffing unlimited times (limited only by dough)\n- For each stuffing type, we can make at most `min(a[i]//b[i], remaining_dough//c[i])` buns\n\nLet's use DP on the dough amount:\n`dp[i]` = maximum money we can earn with `i` grams of dough\n\nFor each stuffing type, we can make 0, 1, 2, ..., up to the maximum possible number of buns.\n\n## Solution Steps\n\n1. Initialize DP array where `dp[i]` represents max profit with `i` grams of dough\n2. For each stuffing type, update the DP array by considering making different numbers of buns\n3. Also consider making buns without stuffing\n4. Return `dp[n]`\n\nLet me trace through the first example:\n- n=10, m=2, c0=2, d0=1\n- Stuffing 1: a=7, b=3, c=2, d=100 \u2192 can make at most min(7//3, 10//2) = min(2,5) = 2 buns\n- Stuffing 2: a=12, b=3, c=1, d=10 \u2192 can make at most min(12//3, 10//1) = min(4,10) = 4 buns\n\nWait, let me re-read... the answer is 241, which means 2\u00d7100 + 4\u00d710 + 1\u00d71 = 241.\nSo we use: 2\u00d72 + 4\u00d71 + 1\u00d72 = 4 + 4 + 2 = 10 grams of dough. Perfect!\n\n## Implementation\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    # Read input\n    line = input().split()\n    n, m, c0, d0 = int(line[0]), int(line[1]), int(line[2]), int(line[3])\n    \n    stuffings = []\n    for _ in range(m):\n        a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())\n        stuffings.append((a, b, c, d))\n    \n    # dp[i] represents maximum money with i grams of dough\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    \n    # First, consider buns without stuffing\n    for dough in range(c0, n + 1):\n        dp[dough] = max(dp[dough], dp[dough - c0] + d0)\n    \n    # For each stuffing type\n    for a, b, c, d in stuffings:\n        # We need to process this in forward direction to avoid using same stuffing multiple times in one iteration\n        # But actually, we can make multiple buns of same type, so we should update in forward direction\n        # Wait, no. We're doing this correctly - for each stuffing type, we consider all possibilities\n        \n        # Create a copy to avoid using updated values in same iteration\n        new_dp = dp[:]\n        \n        # Try making k buns of this stuffing type\n        max_buns = min(a // b, n // c)  # Upper bound on number of buns\n        for k in range(1, max_buns + 1):\n            dough_needed = k * c\n            if dough_needed <= n:\n                for dough in range(dough_needed, n + 1):\n                    new_dp[dough] = max(new_dp[dough], dp[dough - dough_needed] + k * d)\n        \n        dp = new_dp\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\n# Solve and print result\nprint(solve())\n```\n\nWait, let me think about this more carefully.

We have a directed graph with `n` states and `m` transitions\n2. Each state has an action on variable Vasya:\n   - 0: ignore\n   - 1: assign a value\n   - 2: use the variable\n3. A state's value is \"interesting\" if it's part of a valid path where:\n   - The path starts with a state that assigns a value (action = 1)\n   - The path ends with a state that uses the variable (action = 2)\n   - No intermediate states assign values (actions \u2260 1, except the first)\n\n## Approach\n\nThis is essentially finding nodes that lie on paths from \"assign\" nodes to \"use\" nodes, where no intermediate node assigns a value.\n\nLet me think of this systematically:\n\n1. **Forward propagation**: From all assignment nodes (value 1), find all reachable nodes following the constraint that no intermediate node can assign a value\n2. **Backward propagation**: From all use nodes (value 2), find all nodes that can reach them following the same constraint\n3. **Intersection**: Nodes that are reachable in forward pass AND can reach a use node in backward pass are \"interesting\"\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n1. Build the graph representation\n2. Find all assignment nodes (value = 1) and use nodes (value = 2)\n3. For forward pass: BFS/DFS from assignment nodes, only traverse through nodes with value 0 or 2\n4. For backward pass: BFS/DFS from use nodes in reverse graph, only traverse through nodes with value 0 or 1\n5. Mark nodes that appear in both passes as interesting\n\nWait, let me re-read the constraint more carefully...\n\nActually, looking at the examples:\n- Path must start with assignment (1)\n- Path must end with use (2)  \n- No intermediate states can assign values (no 1s except possibly the first)\n\nSo the algorithm should be:\n1. Forward BFS from all nodes with value 1, only going through nodes with value 0 or 2\n2. Backward BFS from all nodes with value 2, only going through nodes with value 0 or 1\n3. Intersection gives us interesting nodes\n\nBut wait - let me trace through example 1:\n- States: [1, 0, 0, 2] \n- Transitions: 1\u21922, 2\u21923, 3\u21924\n- Path: 1\u21922\u21923\u21924 satisfies condition (start=1, end=2, middle=0,0)\n- So all nodes are interesting\n\nLet me trace example 3:\n- States: [2, 0, 1]\n- Transitions: 1\u21923\n- We need path starting with 1 and ending with 2\n- But we have no node with value 1 that can reach node with value 2\n- Node 3 has value 1 but cannot be start of path\n- Node 1 has value 2 but no path leads to it from a value 1 node\n- So no interesting nodes\n\n```python\nfrom collections import defaultdict, deque\n\ndef solve():\n    # Read input\n    n, m = map(int, input().split())\n    actions = list(map(int, input().split()))\n    \n    # Build graph\n    graph = defaultdict(list)\n    reverse_graph = defaultdict(list)\n    \n    for _ in range(m):\n        a, b = map(int, input().split())\n        graph[a].append(b)\n        reverse_graph[b].append(a)\n    \n    # Convert to 0-indexed for internal processing\n    actions = [0] + actions  # Make 1-indexed\n    \n    # Find assignment nodes (value 1) and use nodes (value 2)\n    assignment_nodes = []\n    use_nodes = []\n    \n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if actions[i] == 1:\n            assignment_nodes.append(i)\n        elif actions[i] == 2:\n            use_nodes.append(i)\n    \n    # Forward BFS: from assignment nodes, find all reachable nodes\n    # Can only traverse through nodes with value 0 or 2 (not 1)\n    forward_reachable = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    queue = deque()\n    for node in assignment_nodes:\n        queue.append(node)\n        forward_reachable[node] = True\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        # Can move to nodes with value 0 or 2\n        for next_node in graph[current]:\n            if not forward_reachable[next_node] and actions[next_node] in [0, 2]:\n                forward_reachable[next_node] = True\n                queue.append(next_node)\n    \n    # Backward BFS: from use nodes, find all nodes that can reach them\n    # Can only traverse backwards through nodes with value 0 or 1 (not 2)\n    backward_reachable = [False] * (n + 1)\n    \n    queue = deque()\n    for node in use_nodes:\n        queue.append(node)\n        backward_reachable[node] = True\n    \n    while queue:\n        current = queue.popleft()\n        # Can come from nodes with value 0 or 1\n        for prev_node in reverse_graph[current]:\n            if not backward_reachable[prev_node] and actions[prev_node] in [0, 1]:\n                backward_reachable[prev_node] = True\n                queue.append(prev_node)\n    \n    # A node is interesting if it's reachable from an assignment AND can reach a use\n    result = []\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        if forward_reachable[i] and backward_reachable[i]:\n            result.append(1)\n        else:\n            result.append(0)\n    \n    return result\n\n# Solve and print result\nresult = solve()\nfor r in result:\n    print(r)\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [833], "completion_tokens": [1249], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "87d869a0fd4a510c5e7e310886b86a57"}
