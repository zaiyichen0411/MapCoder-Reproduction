The two parts don't need to be equal\n\n## Analysis\n\nLet's think about when this is possible:\n- We need to split `w` into two even numbers: `a` and `b`\n- So `a + b = w` where both `a` and `b` are even and positive\n- If `a` is even and `b` is even, then `a + b` must be even\n- This means `w` must be even for a solution to exist\n\nBut wait, let's check if `w` being even is sufficient:\n- If `w` is even, we can try `a = 2` and `b = w - 2`\n- For this to work, both `a` and `b` must be positive\n- `a = 2 > 0` \u2713\n- `b = w - 2 > 0` means `w > 2`\n\nWhat about `w = 2`?\n- We'd have `a = 2`, `b = 0`\n- But `b` must be positive, so this doesn't work\n\nSo the conditions are:\n1. `w` must be even\n2. `w` must be greater than 2 (so that both parts can be positive even numbers)\n\n## Verification with Example\n- `w = 8`: Even and > 2, so YES\n- Can split as 2 + 6 or 4 + 4 (both pairs of even numbers)\n\n## Edge Cases\n- `w = 1`: Odd \u2192 NO\n- `w = 2`: Even but we can only split as 1 + 1 (both odd) \u2192 NO  \n- `w = 3`: Odd \u2192 NO\n- `w = 4`: Even and > 2, can split as 2 + 2 \u2192 YES\n\n## Solution Logic\nAnswer is YES if and only if:\n- `w` is even AND `w > 2`\n\n## Code Implementation\n\n```python\ndef can_divide_watermelon(w):\n    # Check if w is even and greater than 2\n    if w % 2 == 0 and w > 2:\n        return \"YES\"\n    else:\n        return \"NO\"\n\n# Read input\nw = int(input())\n\n# Solve and print result\nresult = can_divide_watermelon(w)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nLet me verify this with the sample:\n- Input: 8\n- 8 is even and 8 > 2\n- Output: YES \u2713\n\nThe solution works correctly!"], "prompt_tokens": [395], "completion_tokens": [604], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "230a3c4d7090401e5fa3c6b9d994cdf2"}

The email must be valid:\n   - Contains exactly one `@`\n   - Contains only lowercase letters, `.`, and `@`\n   - Doesn't start/end with `.` or `@`\n4. Goal: Find the shortest valid email, and if there are ties, the lexicographically smallest one\n\n## Approach\n\nThis is a dynamic programming or backtracking problem. We need to try all possible ways to parse the string by replacing `dot` with `.` and `at` with `@`.\n\nLet me think of a recursive approach with memoization:\n- At each position, we can either:\n  - Match `dot` and replace with `.`\n  - Match `at` and replace with `@`\n  - Match a single character (lowercase letter)\n- We need to ensure exactly one `@` appears in the final result\n\n## Implementation Strategy\n\nI'll use dynamic programming with states:\n- Position in the string\n- Number of `@` symbols found so far (0 or 1, since we need exactly 1)\n\nFor each state, I'll store the best result (shortest, lexicographically smallest).\n\nLet me implement this:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Memoization dictionary\n    memo = {}\n    \n    def dp(pos, at_count):\n        # pos: current position in string\n        # at_count: number of @ symbols so far (0 or 1)\n        \n        if (pos, at_count) in memo:\n            return memo[(pos, at_count)]\n        \n        # Base case: reached end of string\n        if pos == len(s):\n            # Valid only if we have exactly one @\n            if at_count == 1:\n                return \"\"\n            else:\n                return None  # Invalid\n        \n        # Try different possibilities\n        results = []\n        \n        # Try matching 'dot' -> '.'\n        if pos + 3 <= len(s) and s[pos:pos+3] == 'dot':\n            rest = dp(pos + 3, at_count)\n            if rest is not None:\n                results.append('.' + rest)\n        \n        # Try matching 'at' -> '@'\n        if pos + 2 <= len(s) and s[pos:pos+2] == 'at':\n            if at_count == 0:  # Only if we haven't placed @ yet\n                rest = dp(pos + 2, 1)\n                if rest is not None:\n                    results.append('@' + rest)\n        \n        # Try matching a single lowercase letter\n        if s[pos].islower():\n            rest = dp(pos + 1, at_count)\n            if rest is not None:\n                results.append(s[pos] + rest)\n        \n        # Find the best result\n        if not results:\n            memo[(pos, at_count)] = None\n            return None\n        \n        # Sort by length first, then lexicographically\n        best = min(results, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n        memo[(pos, at_count)] = best\n        return best\n    \n    result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```\n\nLet me trace through the examples:\n\nExample 1: `vasyaatgmaildotcom`\n- `vasya` + `at` + `gmail` + `dot` + `com`\n- Should become: `vasya@gmail.com`\n\nExample 2: `dotdotdotatdotdotat`\n- This is tricky because we could interpret it in multiple ways\n- Need to find the shortest valid email with exactly one `@`\n\nWait, let me re-read the problem. I think I misunderstood something.\n\nLooking again: \"Overall, two variants of replacement are possible: dot can be replaced by a dot, at can be replaced by an at.\"\n\nThis means we're looking for ways to parse the string where we can replace substrings `dot` with `.` and `at` with `@`, but the result must be a valid email.\n\nLet me revise my approach:\n\n```python\ndef solve():\n    s = input().strip()\n    \n    # Memoization dictionary\n    memo = {}\n    \n    def dp(pos, at_count):\n        # pos: current position in string\n        # at_count: number of @ symbols so far (0 or 1)\n        \n        if (pos, at_count) in memo:\n            return memo[(pos, at_count)]\n        \n        # Base case: reached end of string\n        if pos == len(s):\n            # Valid only if we have exactly one @\n            if at_count == 1:\n                return \"\"\n            else:\n                return None  # Invalid\n        \n        # Try different possibilities\n        results = []\n        \n        # Try matching 'dot' -> '.'\n        if pos + 3 <= len(s) and s[pos:pos+3] == 'dot':\n            rest = dp(pos + 3, at_count)\n            if rest is not None:\n                results.append('.' + rest)\n        \n        # Try matching 'at' -> '@'\n        if pos + 2 <= len(s) and s[pos:pos+2] == 'at':\n            if at_count == 0:  # Only if we haven't placed @ yet\n                rest = dp(pos + 2, 1)\n                if rest is not None:\n                    results.append('@' + rest)\n        \n        # Try matching a single lowercase letter\n        if pos < len(s) and s[pos].islower():\n            rest = dp(pos + 1, at_count)\n            if rest is not None:\n                results.append(s[pos] + rest)\n        \n        # Find the best result\n        if not results:\n            memo[(pos, at_count)] = None\n            return None\n        \n        # Sort by length first, then lexicographically\n        best = min(results, key=lambda x: (len(x), x))\n        memo[(pos, at_count)] = best\n        return best\n    \n    result = dp(0, 0)\n    print(result)\n\nsolve()\n```"], "prompt_tokens": [480], "completion_tokens": [1315], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "a11c9679d8e2dca51be17d466202df6e"}
