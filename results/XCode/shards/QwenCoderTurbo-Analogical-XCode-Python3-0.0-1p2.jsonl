Specifically, we will use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the maximum money we can have for every possible number of shares we might own.\n\n### Tutorial:\n\n**Dynamic Programming (DP)** is an algorithmic paradigm that solves a given complex problem by breaking it down into simpler subproblems and storing the results of these subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.\n\nIn this problem, we need to maximize the money we have after selling our shares. To achieve this, we can use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum money we can have if we own `i` shares.\n\nHere\u2019s how the DP approach works:\n1. Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `max_shares + 1`, where `max_shares` is the maximum number of shares we could potentially own.\n2. Set `dp[0] = r` because initially, we have `r` bourles and zero shares.\n3. Iterate over each buying opportunity and update the DP array accordingly. For each buying opportunity, calculate the new money for each possible number of shares.\n4. Similarly, iterate over each selling opportunity and update the DP array to reflect the money after selling the shares.\n5. Finally, find the maximum value in the DP array, which gives us the maximum money we can have after the evening.\n\n### Example Problems:\n\n#### Problem 1: Maximum Profit from Stock\nGiven prices of stocks over a period of time, find the maximum profit that can be made by buying and selling once.\n\n```python\ndef maxProfit(prices):\n    min_price = float('inf')\n    max_profit = 0\n    for price in prices:\n        min_price = min(min_price, price)\n        max_profit = max(max_profit, price - min_price)\n    return max_profit\n\nprint(maxProfit([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]))  # Output: 5\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II\nGiven an array of prices, you are allowed to complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).\n\n```python\ndef maxProfitII(prices):\n    total_profit = 0\n    for i in range(1, len(prices)):\n        if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:\n            total_profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]\n    return total_profit\n\nprint(maxProfitII([7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]))  # Output: 7\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: House Robber\nYou are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed, the only constraint stopping you from robbing each of them is that adjacent houses have security systems connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.\n\n```python\ndef rob(nums):\n    prev1, prev2 = 0, 0\n    for num in nums:\n        current = max(prev1, prev2 + num)\n        prev2 = prev1\n        prev1 = current\n    return prev1\n\nprint(rob([1, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n## Python3 code to solve the original problem:\n\n```python\ndef maxBourles(n, m, r, s, b):\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[0] = r\n    \n    # Buying opportunities\n    for price in s:\n        for i in range(n, 0, -1):\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1] + (i * price))\n    \n    # Selling opportunities\n    for price in b:\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - 1])\n    \n    return dp[n]\n\n# Read input from standard input\nn, m, r = map(int, input().split())\ns = list(map(int, input().split()))\nb = list(map(int, input().split()))\n\n# Call the function and print the result\nresult = maxBourles(n, m, r, s, b)\nprint(result)\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n\n1. **Initialization**: We initialize a DP array `dp` of size `n + 1` (since we can own up to `n` shares). `dp[0]` is set to `r` because we start with `r` bourles and zero shares.\n2. **Buying Shares**: For each buying opportunity, we iterate backwards through the DP array to ensure that each share count is updated correctly based on previous values.\n3. **Selling Shares**: After processing all buying opportunities, we handle selling opportunities. Selling doesn\u2019t add additional shares but ensures we don\u2019t lose value if we decide not to sell any shares.\n4. **Result**: The final answer is stored in `dp[n]`, which represents the maximum money we can have after the evening if we own `n` shares."], "prompt_tokens": [801], "completion_tokens": [1079], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "42f25d492bddc12d3d89d39315d63cb9"}

This approach is particularly useful when dealing with optimization problems like calculating probabilities.\n\n### Combinatorics\nCombinatorics deals with counting, arrangement, and combination of objects. In this problem, we use combinatorial techniques to calculate the number of ways Hasan can achieve certain scores given his lower bound and the total score.\n\n### Modulo Arithmetic\nSince the answer needs to be reported modulo \\(998244353\\) (which is a prime number), understanding modulo arithmetic and its properties is essential for handling large numbers without overflow.\n\n## Tutorial:\n### Dynamic Programming Basics\nDynamic Programming involves two main steps:\n1. **Define the state**: Identify what state represents the current situation of the problem.\n2. **Transition between states**: Determine how the state changes based on smaller subproblems.\n\n### Combinatorial Counting\nFor counting problems, we often use combinations and permutations. In Python, the `math.comb(n, k)` function can be used to compute \\(C(n, k)\\), which represents the number of ways to choose \\(k\\) items from \\(n\\) items without regard to order.\n\n### Modulo Arithmetic\nModulo arithmetic allows us to perform operations under a finite set of elements. When working with large numbers, taking results modulo a prime number helps prevent overflow and keeps the calculations manageable.\n\n## Example Problems:\n### Problem 1: Coin Change\nGiven coins of different denominations, find the number of ways to make up a certain amount of money.\n\n**Solution**: Use DP to build up the solution.\n\n```python\ndef coin_change(coins, amount):\n    dp = [float('inf')] * (amount + 1)\n    dp[0] = 0\n    for coin in coins:\n        for x in range(coin, amount + 1):\n            dp[x] = min(dp[x], dp[x - coin] + 1)\n    return dp[amount]\n\nprint(coin_change([1, 2, 5], 11))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n### Problem 2: Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS)\nGiven an array of integers, find the length of the longest subsequence such that all elements are sorted in increasing order.\n\n**Solution**: Use DP to keep track of the LIS ending at each index.\n\n```python\ndef length_of_lis(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    dp = [1] * len(nums)\n    for i in range(len(nums)):\n        for j in range(i):\n            if nums[i] > nums[j]:\n                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)\n    return max(dp)\n\nprint(length_of_lis([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Problem 3: Number of Ways to Climb Stairs\nGiven \\(n\\) stairs, find the number of distinct ways to climb to the top. You can either climb 1 step or 2 steps at a time.\n\n**Solution**: Use DP to count the number of ways to reach each step.\n\n```python\ndef climb_stairs(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return 1\n    dp = [0] * (n + 1)\n    dp[1], dp[2] = 1, 2\n    for i in range(3, n + 1):\n        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2]\n    return dp[n]\n\nprint(climb_stairs(3))  # Output: 3\n```\n\n## Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem:\n\n### Explanation of the Solution:\n1. **Understand Constraints**: We need to find the number of valid sequences where the sum of the scores equals \\(s\\) and the first element is at least \\(r\\).\n2. **Use DP Table**: Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of ways to achieve a sum of \\(j\\) using the first \\(i\\) players.\n3. **Iterate and Update DP Table**: Fill the DP table considering the constraints.\n4. **Calculate Probability**: Normalize the result by dividing by the total number of ways to distribute the sum \\(s\\) among \\(p\\) players.\n\n### Python3 Code:\n\n```python\nMOD = 998244353\n\ndef mod_inv(a, m=MOD):\n    return pow(a, m - 2, m)\n\ndef binom(n, k):\n    if k > n:\n        return 0\n    num = den = 1\n    for i in range(k):\n        num = num * (n - i) % MOD\n        den = den * (i + 1) % MOD\n    return num * mod_inv(den, MOD) % MOD\n\ndef solve(p, s, r):\n    dp = [[0] * (s + 1) for _ in range(p + 1)]\n    dp[0][0] = 1\n    \n    for i in range(1, p + 1):\n        for j in range(s + 1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]\n            if j >= r:\n                dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - r]\n                dp[i][j] %= MOD\n    \n    total_ways = binom(s + p - 1, p - 1)\n    \n    win_ways = 0\n    for j in range(r, s + 1):\n        if dp[p][j] > 0:\n            win_ways += dp[p][j] * binom(s - j, p - 1)\n            win_ways %= MOD\n    \n    prob = win_ways * mod_inv(total_ways, MOD) % MOD\n    return prob\n\n# Read input\np, s, r = map(int, input().split())\n\n# Calculate and print the result\nresult = solve(p, s, r)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem and calculates the probability of Hasan winning the game."], "prompt_tokens": [986], "completion_tokens": [1336], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": false, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "609195ef4a970c62a8210dafe118580e"}
