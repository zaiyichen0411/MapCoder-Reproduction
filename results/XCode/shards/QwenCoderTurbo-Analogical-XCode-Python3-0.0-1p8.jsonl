The key concept here is **pattern matching**. We need to check if all the characters of \"hello\" appear in `s` in order, regardless of how many characters are deleted.\n\n### Algorithm\n1. Initialize two pointers, one for the string `s` and another for the string \"hello\".\n2. Traverse through the string `s` using the pointer for `s`.\n3. For each character in `s`, check if it matches the current character in \"hello\".\n4. If there is a match, move the pointer for \"hello\" to the next character.\n5. After traversing `s`, check if the pointer for \"hello\" has reached the end of \"hello\". If it has, return \"YES\". Otherwise, return \"NO\".\n\n### Tutorial\nPattern matching is a fundamental algorithmic technique used to find occurrences of a pattern within a text. In this case, we're looking for the sequence of characters \"hello\" within the string `s`.\n\n### Example Problems\n#### Problem 1: Substring Check\n**Problem**: Given two strings `a` and `b`, determine if `a` is a substring of `b`.\n\n**Solution**: Use two pointers to traverse both strings and check if the characters match sequentially.\n\n```python\ndef is_substring(a, b):\n    i, j = 0, 0\n    while i < len(a) and j < len(b):\n        if a[i] == b[j]:\n            i += 1\n        j += 1\n    return i == len(a)\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_substring(\"abc\", \"abcdef\"))  # True\nprint(is_substring(\"xyz\", \"abcde\"))   # False\n```\n\n#### Problem 2: Longest Common Subsequence\n**Problem**: Given two strings `X` and `Y`, find the longest common subsequence between them.\n\n**Solution**: Use dynamic programming to build a table where each cell `(i, j)` represents the length of the LCS of the substrings `X[0..i]` and `Y[0..j]`.\n\n```python\ndef lcs(X, Y):\n    m, n = len(X), len(Y)\n    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]\n    \n    for i in range(1, m + 1):\n        for j in range(1, n + 1):\n            if X[i - 1] == Y[j - 1]:\n                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1\n            else:\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])\n    \n    return dp[m][n]\n\n# Test cases\nprint(lcs(\"AGGTAB\", \"GXTXAYB\"))  # 4\n```\n\n#### Problem 3: Isomorphic Strings\n**Problem**: Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic, meaning there exists a bijection between characters of `s` and `t`.\n\n**Solution**: Use two dictionaries to map characters from `s` to `t` and vice versa, ensuring consistency.\n\n```python\ndef is_isomorphic(s, t):\n    if len(s) != len(t):\n        return False\n    \n    s_to_t, t_to_s = {}, {}\n    for char_s, char_t in zip(s, t):\n        if char_s not in s_to_t and char_t not in t_to_s:\n            s_to_t[char_s] = char_t\n            t_to_s[char_t] = char_s\n        elif s_to_t.get(char_s) != char_t or t_to_s.get(char_t) != char_s:\n            return False\n    \n    return True\n\n# Test cases\nprint(is_isomorphic(\"egg\", \"add\"))  # True\nprint(is_isomorphic(\"foo\", \"bar\"))  # False\n```\n\n### Python3 Code to Solve the Original Problem\n```python\ndef can_say_hello(s):\n    hello_index = 0\n    for char in s:\n        if hello_index < len(\"hello\") and char == \"hello\"[hello_index]:\n            hello_index += 1\n    return \"YES\" if hello_index == len(\"hello\") else \"NO\"\n\n# Take input from standard input\ninput_string = input()\nresult = can_say_hello(input_string)\nprint(result)\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `can_say_hello` that checks if the given string `s` can be transformed into \"hello\" by deleting some characters. It uses a pointer approach to ensure all characters of \"hello\" appear in order. Finally, it prints \"YES\" if possible, otherwise \"NO\"."], "prompt_tokens": [474], "completion_tokens": [1020], "no_of_try": 1, "is_solved": true, "language": "Python3", "task_id": "c5d19dc8f2478ee8d9cba8cc2e4cd838"}

This is essential for transforming the given string into a format that closely resembles a valid email address.\n\n#### Lexicographical Order:\nComparing strings lexicographically means comparing them based on their dictionary order. In Python, this can be achieved directly using comparison operators (`<`, `>`, etc.) which perform lexicographical comparisons based on ASCII values.\n\n#### Validation Check:\nTo verify if a string forms a valid email address, check the following conditions:\n- Does not start or end with '.' or '@'.\n- Contains exactly one '@'.\n- All characters are either '.', '@', or lowercase Latin letters.\n\n#### Optimization:\nMinimizing the length of the resultant email address requires careful placement of '@' and removal of unnecessary '.'.

{"description": "For each positive integer n consider the integer \u03c8(n) which is obtained from n by replacing every digit a in the decimal notation of n with the digit (9\u2009\u2009-\u2009\u2009a). We say that \u03c8(n) is the reflection of n. For example, reflection of 192 equals 807. Note that leading zeros (if any) should be omitted. So reflection of 9 equals 0, reflection of 91 equals 8.Let us call the weight of the number the product of the number and its reflection. Thus, the weight of the number 10 is equal to 10\u00b789\u2009=\u2009890.Your task is to find the maximum weight of the numbers in the given range [l,\u2009r] (boundaries are included).", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "2 seconds", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "Input contains two space-separated integers l and r (1\u2009\u2264\u2009l\u2009\u2264\u2009r\u2009\u2264\u2009109) \u2014 bounds of the range.", "output_spec": "Output should contain single integer number: maximum value of the product n\u00b7\u03c8(n), where l\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u2009r.
