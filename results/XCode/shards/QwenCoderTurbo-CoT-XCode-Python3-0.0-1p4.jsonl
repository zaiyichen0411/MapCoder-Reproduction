{"description": "One day Petya was solving a very interesting problem. But although he used many optimization techniques, his solution still got Time limit exceeded verdict. Petya conducted a thorough analysis of his program and found out that his function for finding maximum element in an array of n positive integers was too slow. Desperate, Petya decided to use a somewhat unexpected optimization using parameter k, so now his function contains the following code:int fast_max(int n, int a[]) {     int ans = 0;    int offset = 0;    for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; ++i)        if (ans &lt; a[i]) {            ans = a[i];            offset = 0;        } else {            offset = offset + 1;            if (offset == k)                return ans;        }    return ans;}That way the function iteratively checks array elements, storing the intermediate maximum, and if after k consecutive iterations that maximum has not changed, it is returned as the answer.Now Petya is interested in fault rate of his function. He asked you to find the number of permutations of integers from 1 to n such that the return value of his function on those permutations is not equal to n.

{"description": "Let's define the permutation of length n as an array p\u2009=\u2009[p1,\u2009p2,\u2009...,\u2009pn] consisting of n distinct integers from range from 1 to n. We say that this permutation maps value 1 into the value p1, value 2 into the value p2 and so on.Kyota Ootori has just learned about cyclic representation of a permutation. A cycle is a sequence of numbers such that each element of this sequence is being mapped into the next element of this sequence (and the last element of the cycle is being mapped into the first element of the cycle). The cyclic representation is a representation of p as a collection of cycles forming p. For example, permutation p\u2009=\u2009[4,\u20091,\u20096,\u20092,\u20095,\u20093] has a cyclic representation that looks like (142)(36)(5) because 1 is replaced by 4, 4 is replaced by 2, 2 is replaced by 1, 3 and 6 are swapped, and 5 remains in place. Permutation may have several cyclic representations, so Kyoya defines the standard cyclic representation of a permutation as follows. First, reorder the elements within each cycle so the largest element is first. Then, reorder all of the cycles so they are sorted by their first element. For our example above, the standard cyclic representation of [4,\u20091,\u20096,\u20092,\u20095,\u20093] is (421)(5)(63).Now, Kyoya notices that if we drop the parenthesis in the standard cyclic representation, we get another permutation! For instance, [4,\u20091,\u20096,\u20092,\u20095,\u20093] will become [4,\u20092,\u20091,\u20095,\u20096,\u20093].Kyoya notices that some permutations don't change after applying operation described above at all. He wrote all permutations of length n that do not change in a list in lexicographic order. Unfortunately, his friend Tamaki Suoh lost this list.
