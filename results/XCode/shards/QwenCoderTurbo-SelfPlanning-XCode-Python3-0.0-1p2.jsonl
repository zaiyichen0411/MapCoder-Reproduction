{"description": "Young Teodor enjoys drawing. His favourite hobby is drawing segments with integer borders inside his huge [1;m] segment. One day Teodor noticed that picture he just drawn has one interesting feature: there doesn't exist an integer point, that belongs each of segments in the picture. Having discovered this fact, Teodor decided to share it with Sasha.Sasha knows that Teodor likes to show off so he never trusts him. Teodor wants to prove that he can be trusted sometimes, so he decided to convince Sasha that there is no such integer point in his picture, which belongs to each segment. However Teodor is lazy person and neither wills to tell Sasha all coordinates of segments' ends nor wills to tell him their amount, so he suggested Sasha to ask him series of questions 'Given the integer point xi, how many segments in Fedya's picture contain that point?', promising to tell correct answers for this questions.Both boys are very busy studying and don't have much time, so they ask you to find out how many questions can Sasha ask Teodor, that having only answers on his questions, Sasha can't be sure that Teodor isn't lying to him. Note that Sasha doesn't know amount of segments in Teodor's picture.

{"description": "Hasan loves playing games and has recently discovered a game called TopScore. In this soccer-like game there are $$$p$$$ players doing penalty shoot-outs. Winner is the one who scores the most. In case of ties, one of the top-scorers will be declared as the winner randomly with equal probability.They have just finished the game and now are waiting for the result. But there's a tiny problem! The judges have lost the paper of scores! Fortunately they have calculated sum of the scores before they get lost and also for some of the players they have remembered a lower bound on how much they scored. However, the information about the bounds is private, so Hasan only got to know his bound.According to the available data, he knows that his score is at least $$$r$$$ and sum of the scores is $$$s$$$.Thus the final state of the game can be represented in form of sequence of $$$p$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_p$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i$$$) \u2014 player's scores. Hasan is player number $$$1$$$, so $$$a_1 \\ge r$$$. Also $$$a_1 + a_2 + \\dots + a_p = s$$$. Two states are considered different if there exists some position $$$i$$$ such that the value of $$$a_i$$$ differs in these states. Once again, Hasan doesn't know the exact scores (he doesn't know his exact score as well). So he considers each of the final states to be equally probable to achieve.Help Hasan find the probability of him winning.It can be shown that it is in the form of $$$\\frac{P}{Q}$$$ where $$$P$$$ and $$$Q$$$ are non-negative integers and $$$Q \\ne 0$$$, $$$P \\le Q$$$.
