{"description": "The Floral Clock has been standing by the side of Mirror Lake for years. Though unable to keep time, it reminds people of the passage of time and the good old days.On the rim of the Floral Clock are 2n flowers, numbered from 1 to 2n clockwise, each of which has a colour among all n possible ones. For each colour, there are exactly two flowers with it, the distance between which either is less than or equal to 2, or equals n. Additionally, if flowers u and v are of the same colour, then flowers opposite to u and opposite to v should be of the same colour as well \u2014 symmetry is beautiful!Formally, the distance between two flowers is 1 plus the number of flowers on the minor arc (or semicircle) between them. Below is a possible arrangement with n\u2009=\u20096 that cover all possibilities.  The beauty of an arrangement is defined to be the product of the lengths of flower segments separated by all opposite flowers of the same colour. In other words, in order to compute the beauty, we remove from the circle all flowers that have the same colour as flowers opposite to them. Then, the beauty is the product of lengths of all remaining segments. Note that we include segments of length 0 in this product. If there are no flowers that have the same colour as flower opposite to them, the beauty equals 0. For instance, the beauty of the above arrangement equals 1\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009\u00d7\u20091\u2009\u00d7\u20093\u2009=\u20099 \u2014 the segments are {2}, {4,\u20095,\u20096}, {8} and {10,\u200911,\u200912}.While keeping the constraints satisfied, there may be lots of different arrangements.

{"description": "Holidays have finished. Thanks to the help of the hacker Leha, Noora managed to enter the university of her dreams which is located in a town Pavlopolis. It's well known that universities provide students with dormitory for the period of university studies. Consequently Noora had to leave Vi\u010dkopolis and move to Pavlopolis. Thus Leha was left completely alone in a quiet town Vi\u010dkopolis. He almost even fell into a depression from boredom!Leha came up with a task for himself to relax a little. He chooses two integers A and B and then calculates the greatest common divisor of integers \"A factorial\" and \"B factorial\". Formally the hacker wants to find out GCD(A!,\u2009B!). It's well known that the factorial of an integer x is a product of all positive integers less than or equal to x. Thus x!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b7...\u00b7(x\u2009-\u20091)\u00b7x. For example 4!\u2009=\u20091\u00b72\u00b73\u00b74\u2009=\u200924. Recall that GCD(x,\u2009y) is the largest positive integer q that divides (without a remainder) both x and y.Leha has learned how to solve this task very effective.
