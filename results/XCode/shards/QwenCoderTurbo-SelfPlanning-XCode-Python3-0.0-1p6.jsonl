{"description": "Special Agent Smart Beaver works in a secret research department of ABBYY. He's been working there for a long time and is satisfied with his job, as it allows him to eat out in the best restaurants and order the most expensive and exotic wood types there. The content special agent has got an important task: to get the latest research by British scientists on the English Language. These developments are encoded and stored in a large safe. The Beaver's teeth are strong enough, so the authorities assured that upon arriving at the place the beaver won't have any problems with opening the safe.And he finishes his aspen sprig and leaves for this important task. Of course, the Beaver arrived at the location without any problems, but alas. He can't open the safe with his strong and big teeth. At this point, the Smart Beaver get a call from the headquarters and learns that opening the safe with the teeth is not necessary, as a reliable source has sent the following information: the safe code consists of digits and has no leading zeroes. There also is a special hint, which can be used to open the safe. The hint is string s with the following structure:  if si = \"?\", then the digit that goes i-th in the safe code can be anything (between 0 to 9, inclusively);  if si is a digit (between 0 to 9, inclusively), then it means that there is digit si on position i in code;  if the string contains letters from \"A\" to \"J\", then all positions with the same letters must contain the same digits and the positions with distinct letters must contain distinct digits.  The length of the safe code coincides with the length of the hint. For example, hint \"?JGJ9\" has such matching safe code variants: \"51919\", \"55959\", \"12329\", \"93539\" and so on, and has wrong variants such as: \"56669\", \"00111\", \"03539\" and \"13666\".After receiving such information, the authorities change the plan and ask the special agents to work quietly and gently and not to try to open the safe by mechanical means, and try to find the password using the given hint.At a special agent school the Smart Beaver was the fastest in his platoon finding codes for such safes, but now he is not in that shape: the years take their toll ... Help him to determine the number of possible variants of the code to the safe, matching the given hint. After receiving this information, and knowing his own speed of entering codes, the Smart Beaver will be able to determine whether he will have time for tonight's show \"Beavers are on the trail\" on his favorite TV channel, or he should work for a sleepless night...", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "1 second", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "The first line contains string s \u2014 the hint to the safe code.

{"description": "Smart Beaver is careful about his appearance and pays special attention to shoes so he has a huge number of pairs of shoes from the most famous brands of the forest. He's trying to handle his shoes carefully so that each pair stood side by side. But by the end of the week because of his very active lifestyle in his dressing room becomes a mess.Smart Beaver from ABBYY is not only the brightest beaver in the area, but he also is the most domestically oriented. For example, on Mondays the Smart Beaver cleans everything in his home.It's Monday morning. Smart Beaver does not want to spend the whole day cleaning, besides, there is much in to do and it\u2019s the gym day, so he wants to clean up as soon as possible. Now the floors are washed, the dust is wiped off \u2014 it\u2019s time to clean up in the dressing room. But as soon as the Smart Beaver entered the dressing room, all plans for the day were suddenly destroyed: chaos reigned there and it seemed impossible to handle, even in a week. Give our hero some hope: tell him what is the minimum number of shoes need to change the position to make the dressing room neat.The dressing room is rectangular and is divided into n\u2009\u00d7\u2009m equal squares, each square contains exactly one shoe. Each pair of shoes has a unique number that is integer from 1 to , more formally, a square with coordinates (i,\u2009j) contains an integer number of the pair which is lying on it. The Smart Beaver believes that the dressing room is neat only when each pair of sneakers lies together. We assume that the pair of sneakers in squares (i1,\u2009j1) and (i2,\u2009j2) lies together if |i1\u2009-\u2009i2|\u2009+\u2009|j1\u2009-\u2009j2|\u2009=\u20091.", "input_from": "standard input", "output_to": "standard output", "time_limit": "4 seconds", "memory_limit": "256 megabytes", "input_spec": "The first line contains two space-separated integers n and m.

The stretch of DNA is represented by a string containing only the characters 'A', 'T', 'G' and 'C'.Manao has determined that if the stretch of DNA contains a maximal sequence of consecutive identical nucleotides that is of even length, then the protein will be nonfunctional. For example, consider a protein described by DNA string \"GTTAAAG\". It contains four maximal sequences of consecutive identical nucleotides: \"G\", \"TT\", \"AAA\", and \"G\". The protein is nonfunctional because sequence \"TT\" has even length.Manao is trying to obtain a functional protein from the protein he currently has.

When the head coder came home after work he wanted to re-do the trick. Unfortunately, he didn't remember the starting or the final position of the cups.
